       "3   Finally a story I can tell lol. My cousin works in fashion and previously worked for a designer who dressed Naomi Campbell for Cannes yeaaars ago. The designer was doing a fitting with her in her hotel room and Naomi suddenly wanted to change the length of the gown so her and a seamstress spent hours into the night opening the dress and doing the alteration on the spot and Naomi was sitting there bitching about them on the phone to random people and refusing to look at them when talking to them. \"Very annoying, but in situations like that what can you do\" is what she said lol.   \n",

Adriana was spending so much time at the gym she basically lived there. I hate the fashion industry and its standards for women's bodies!   \n",

The designer was doing a fitting with her in her hotel room and Naomi suddenly wanted to change the length of the gown so her and a seamstress spent hours into the night opening the dress and doing the alteration on the spot and Naomi was sitting there bitching about them on the phone to random people and refusing to look at them when talking to them. \"Very annoying, but in situations like that what can you do\" is what she said lol.   \n",

       "3        Finally a story I can tell lol My cousin works in fashion and previously worked for a designer who dressed Naomi Campbell for Cannes yeaaars ago The designer was doing a fitting with her in her hotel room and Naomi suddenly wanted to change the length of the gown so her and a seamstress spent hours into the night opening the dress and doing the alteration on the spot and Naomi was sitting there bitching about them on the phone to random people and refusing to look at them when talking to them Very annoying but in situations like that what can you do is what she said lol\n",
