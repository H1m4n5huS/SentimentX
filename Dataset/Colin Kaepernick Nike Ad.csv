15.0,,0,2018-09-18T00:48:33Z,"The main point here is that Kaepernick is being lauded for feeding into something that was perpetuated to sow discord and to ensure Hillary was elected.  Soros did not fund BLM because he cared about African Americans at all, but instead it was a platform to incite animosity, as the news coverage leading up to it was intentional provocation that would have made Goebbels proud.  Such a cynical attempt to manipulate minorities should be obvious, because as soon as it didn‚Äôt work to galvanize the black vote the media propaganda driving it slowed to a crawl, and no one ever mentioned that a young black male is 1000X more likely to be shot by another black male than a cop, so did they ever really care?  All Americans should realize we all share the blame for black on black crime.  We have to work together to address decades of intentional oppression, but this just isn‚Äôt helping at All.... and don‚Äôt think that wasn‚Äôt the idea.   Kaepernick and many others were grossly manipulated, but serving the puppet master at least got him paid."

Donald Trump is the only one that attack America, colluding with Russia, and refusing to put the flag at half staff for JOHN McCain a war Hero.  white people should be taking a knee for that shit. Kaepernick kneel because every time he wake up another innocent black person died at the hands of the KKK police. Go watch his press statement and you will hear it for your self. Their are a lot of good decent God fearing white people that really want to do the right thing but watching FOX News is like sitting at the table of the KKK,  You will never get a message of love for black people and their pain, all i can say some of you white people nee to get on the right side of history and not let the judgement of God fall on you and your families.

Too much crapola spewing from to many dumbass companies these days; mainly, for profit at the expense of social discourse and victimizing campaigns.

What's more disturbing is the bigotry found in the comments than some kneeling dumbass activist who puts his perceived issues above the national anthem which is meant to ""evoke[s] and eulogize[s] the history, traditions, and struggles of its people, recognized either by a nation's government as the official national song, or by convention through use by the people."" If anything he should be standing taller and more proud during the anthem and protesting his take on this issue another way. Clearly, Nike, Kaepernick, and many others are clueless.

If there is a topic brought to discussion you shouldn‚Äôt want to get rid of it, you should jump at the chance to fix it.

Imagine if the nfl made you recite verses from the Quran before the game. You can imagine a number of people would not be partaking which is their right.

In my personal opinion his views are sophomoric, even infantile. 
For real credibility, Tucker needs to be made to live the life of a black man for 2 full years in an urban, Chicago or Detroit non gentrified, inner city community.  
After that, let's hear his commentary on these type of questions.  I guarantee you that having to deal with over-privileged smug dismissive white folks, like himself, while trying to find a job, support a family, and dodge the police (looking for soft targets to support easy money boosts to their departments) while wearing ""blue black"" skin, will be an interesting Fox News Series. Let's call it: Esau's Test.
The new black man masks and limbs the police wear are readily available to Fox News bigots.

1. take aggressive action against (a place or enemy forces) with weapons or armed force, typically in a battle or war.

noun
1.
an aggressive and violent action against a person or place.

YESTERDAY FOR MY PEOPLE, ASSHOLE, ALL I DID WAS at around 10 am, when the bus started to fill up and an elderly black woman boarded I stood up and gave her my seat. Then bout 20 minutes later same situation but I gave my bus seat to an elderly white woman. That shit probably don't mean nothing to you because I'll bet one, or both of them isn't ""your people"". Am I right, asshole?  So you probably wouldn't have stood up.
Later in the afternoon on the train I moved for an overweight, very flamboyant gay man. You would have probably made room for him on your lap.
I really don't care about the differences between the colored people (whites), versus the people of color (blue, brown, other). Gay (happy) versus straight (having an erection).
I just care if people are good or bad, and if they are fucking idiots. I have to decide by myself with everyone I meet and it's generally done within five minutes.
If I made any part of that quick evaluation based on race I would kill myself. But not without doing a greater public service first. Travel to wherever my parents were and kill them, because that sort of passed-on thinking would have made them complete total failures as parents and people."

I don't disagree with a word you wrote. For the uneducated and/or people who caught some of the Pat Tillman story but not all of it; Respectfully, anyone can fact-check me.
Please allow me to summarily set the record straight using your words, Mr. Cuffe.
What Pat Tillman gave was a true personal sacrifice.
What the U.S. Army took from the Tillman family was a true public Sacrifice.

You know what?
It has taken your simple, bumper-sticker response (not an insult!) with The U.S. Flag at the end of your comment to make me uneasy and get me thinking...
My final thought is that it is an absolute humiliation, an embarrassment, a very personal insult to me as an American to have The U.S. Flag on ""ALL"" U.S. Military personnel and staff uniforms.
I don't have any idea on anyone or any Branch, etc. immediately in mind to change. But I am supremely, unwavering in my solid knowledge (""intelligence"") that the American Flag always represents the people of our country.  The U.S. Military and it's huge multi-structured web of influence often represents the people of our country, and often does not. The stakes are grave in each case.

Just so you know a little about me. I'm 6' 4"", 238 lbs. and I cry during flyovers before football games. Our government has become so fucked up. Haven't seen anything better, except what we had. If we ever had more truth..."

Everyone might not like it, but just as burning the flag is protected free speech, there's nothing illegal about taking a knee.  In fact, one could argue that both are the highest example of American freedom.  No one is taking anything from me when they burn a flag or take a knee during the National Anthem.

,212.0,0,2018-09-07T05:41:41Z,"Ashleigh I do apologize for saying you are ridding on you father's coat tail.  And again I deeply respect your father's military service.  Your father choose to bring honor to our great country and his contribution help make America what it is today.  You say Kapernick did a lot of ""good"" things, ok but he also did a very ""disrespectful"" thing to our Nation.  I still don't get why he is considered a ""hero"" and never will, but that's ok I don't get it.  I mean he didn't lay down his life for anyone.  I totally get M.L.K. being in a place of honor, his courage spoke volumes.   Bottom line is maybe we have different interpretations of what the word ""hero"" really is.  You are correct I don't know you, but I do respect your right to voice you opinion.  Have a good day!"
,213.0,0,2018-09-07T02:35:36Z,"Thank you for ""honoring"" my dad. However, to say that I am ridding on his coat tail is very disrespectful and an invalid statement. To be ridding on his coat tail would mean that I would be in the services myself expecting that same rank and benefits that he has and had. I am not in the services and no I do not ride his coat tail. You do not know me and I do not know you, so to tell me about the kind of relationship that I have with my dad seems to be assuming and that's one thing you should never do. Moving on, to say that ""if it wasn't for the Europeans, you and I wouldn't be here"" as if that is something that African Americans wanted from the jump is also an ignorant statement. I would have loved to at least experienced what my life would have been like before my ancestors were deprived of their livelihood and taken from their land. I realize that for most white Americans, living in America is a ""privilege"" but to African Americans like myself who are faced with injustices and racial differences on a daily basis, it is not a privilege to be here. I just see it as life as we know it. Also, because I am a woman of faith, I owe my entire existence to my Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ! He is the real reason I am here. Now, I shouldn't have to be the one doing all the educating here, so when you do research on the great work Colin Kaepernick has been doing out in the communities; before, during, and after his Pro football career, then you can come to me and have and educated discussion on why he is being looked at as a role model. I don't Idolize anyone but God, but I will acknowledge those who are setting the examples of being great human beings to all mankind. Why are you so upset that his talents earned him a spot to play in the NFL or that NIKE went to Colin and asked him to be the face of the Ad Campaign? He didn't ask for any of that, he was blessed with it. Also, why are you just now wanting to boycott NIKE, Colin has been endorsed by them for a while even post NFL??? He has been a walking billboard for them and no one says anything until now? What sense does that make??? I will leave you with this, never be upset about someone else's blessings because you may just be hindering your own blessings. What's meant for you, will be for you and what's meant for someone else will be for them. No matter if you disagree/agree with it or no matter what they decide to do with their blessing, it will be for them to figure out when they cross that bridge."
,214.0,0,2018-09-07T00:21:53Z,"Ashleigh God bless your dad for his military service.  But you might just be ridding on his ""coat tail"" of his hard work.  I don't condone what the Europeans did to the Native Americans.  Nor do I condone slavery.  But if you think about it you or I would not be here if it weren't for the Europeans coming to America, unless of course you happen to be a Native American Indian.  But tell me just what did  Kapernick ever do that warrantz the idolization he is getting.  Kapernick has found his niche in life.  He is a ""one trick pony"".  Now give me some real evidence of his courage like you did with your father.  You dad a courageous man and I can give him the honor he deserves.  Kapernick , no I am just not seeing him as a person that has done anything to be treated like a hero."

Your white educators failed you miserably. You stole land from people and brought slaves over here to build everything you now enjoy and you want the black people to be deported? Now what sense does that actually make. Yeah you want to enjoy the fruits of our labor and then holler send them back. Just remember how this ""America"" came about, and make sure you read in history about the black soldiers who stood at the front line of the battle to be killed first because the white troops who were supposed to be their brothers, wanted to protect themselves and return to their families. The real heroes are those black men and women sacrificed feeding their child so that the black woman could have a white baby sucking on her titty only to be viewed as an animal or something of no value. So go ahead and try to deport Colin if you want you, slave days are over... My dad is now a RETIRED NAVY VET, and he agrees with Colin because he fought for my rights, Colin's rights, and your rights to sit there and make the ignorant comments that you have made. It was not about the flag (a piece of cloth) for my dad's enlisting into the navy that he was fighting for, it was about the principles that the flag represented that we all now know to be a lie because those principles only protect a certain people and not everyone. Please educate yourself not only about the blacks role in the shaping of America, but also systematic mentality of the U.S. in general and make sure that you come with facts when you are disputing this topic."

I also found that he really supports education in the inner city because he feels that is away to help inner city youth overcome obstacles that others never face.  Also, a little researched showed that Kaepernick ""the guy"" has donated over a million dollars to help those in need. I can see why Tucker doesn't find that interesting.

738.0,,0,2018-09-06T02:50:58Z,"Nike will be just fine. They are going to be more popular sports shoes and equipment than ever before and will now represent constant protests against hypocritical racist white America that values its silly songs, flags and white privileged society more than the equality, justice, civil rights, freedom and lives of black and brown Americans. Every time that iconic ""Swoosh"" is seen--it will be a middle finger in the face of the racist, fascist, and self-centered element of white America. Kaepernick's #7 SF 49ers jersey is also such a symbol and has become extremely popular as a means to say ""F-you"" to America's far-right racists. I attended the Baltimore Raven/ Jacksonville Jaguars NFL game in London last year. I saw with my own eyes and was very proud and delighted to see nearly all of the NFL players kneeling for the Anthem. It was a huge news story in London. Many British fans at the game wore Kaepernick's jersey. I spoke with many of them who said they loved what Kaepernick stood for fighting racism and police brutality back in America. They also spoke of revulsion for Trump and total shock and surprise that such a highly advanced society as America would elect such a racist idiot as their president. I told those I spoke to that Trump was elected to restore white supremacy to America and that was 99% of the reason for his election. That he would ""make America great again"" by making America white again. This means that people of color in America would soon find state sponsored oppression taking effect which did in the form of all Hispanics in America now finding themselves stopped and harassed by ICE even when they were born here and little brown children getting put into jail cells and chain linked fence cages. All this has proven that it was going to happen; therefore, what I told the white British people I met has turned out to be true. However, Trump and his diabolical fascist traitor supporters have now found themselves coming against a resistance far more powerful and determined to protect freedom and democracy than they every anticipated. The NFL players defiantly continued their National Anthem protests, ""Unite the Right 2"" got shut down, Silent Sam got torn down and now Nike has very defiantly and bravely decided to risk everything to support Colin Kaepernick and his righteous protest as noble as that of the late-great Muhammad Ali. Those who fight for righteousness and the freedom of the human spirit always win as martyrs in the long run--this includes my savior, Jesus Christ, Mahatma Ghandi, MLK, and Nelson Mandela. Mr. Kaepernick will also be revered by history as a warrior for human rights and civil rights against fascist and racist white America. ANTIFA forever! Black Lives Matter and God bless brave black warrior king, Colin Kaepernick! God bless Nike as well. I'll be hitting the shoe stores this weekend picking up my brand new Nike shoes! LOL!"
,267.0,0,2018-09-07T23:51:58Z,"Yeah, but a lot of people were drawn to Trump's legendary bigotry with even the KKK saying they felt more emboldened to start appearing in public again with their white hoods, robes and Confederate flags. The night Trump got elected and days after, people of color and Jews in America saw the return of open racial name calling and harassment. The God awful Charlottesville ""Unite the Right"" hate rally and all the neo-Nazis, neo-Confederates and Alt.Right racist groups that attended--including one time KKK Grand Wizard (lizard), David Duke--all said they felt greatly supported by Trump's White House and said publicly that they felt greatly encouraged and emboldened to organize the rally and to attend it. Sorry, but voting for a man with the blatantly open characteristics of Adolf Hitler and certainly after his infamous, ""Grab 'em by the pussy"" remark--speaks volumes of the character of the average Trump supporter and that is they are racist, misogynistic, xenophobic and intolerant scumbags--more selfishly concerned with their access to life, liberty and their pursuit of happiness above America's black and brown people as well as women, who I found so strange in supporting Trump after his disgusting remark and well known history of sexism. But, again, support of Trump really shows the underbelly of a typical Trump supporter and that is of a racists, as white American women are just as racist as white men--in fact, I view white women in America as just the other white men. Same racist attitudes; same racist behavior. However, what really is shocking is the blatant hypocrisy of calling black NFL players who kneel for the National Anthem ""un-patriotic,"" but hold no such views towards those who support very un-American Confederate flags and monuments--not to mention continue to support Trump despite his saying their were ""good people"" on the side of the KKK and neo-Nazis at Charlottesville, who were very violent and beat people as well as killed a women. Trump supporters are also very hypocritical for saying how patriotic they are over the National Anthem, but hold no concern that Russia was proven to have interfered in our democratic elections and continue to do so right now!"

Unfortunately this country was built off of racial division, and sadly will continue to if things aren‚Äôt changed in ALL communities. All brands pick and choose who they appeal too more, like old navy has much more white buyers so most advertisements are white faces, Nike to me appealed to all and their other companies within were advertised by racial majorities. Like Converse,Hurley, Cole Han, Jordan‚Äôs, etc. so to me Nike covered ALL races, so those who are burning and overreacting need to understand Nike wasn‚Äôt just for ‚Äúsneaker heads‚Äù it is a brand for everyone. So keep burning and acting dumb because one race doing it will not effect anything.period. Instead they should be donating to the veterans that they are so passionate about respecting yet our government has our Vets on the streets.

805.0,,12,2018-09-06T00:27:03Z,Dear mr. Tucker: Kaepernick chose to protest during the national anthem because it would bring a focus a spotlight on what he was protesting. I think that kneeling in front of the flag is much more humble than standing. A kneeling person is sending the message of submission or prayer.

Football was a lot of peoples escape from real life issues. And America is divided enough and his stance caused more separation. Just wearing a team shirt could drum a positive conversation amongst strangers and after him taking a kneel and the media made a big deal out of people. Now wearing a team shirt can cause pure hate on both sides. Trust everything is scripted... Take it how you like it.

818.0,,0,2018-09-05T23:52:10Z,"I applaud and commend the great and bold stance that Nike took with their new ad featuring Colin Kaepernick as the narrator. Nicely done Nike to highlight that America is about diversity and inclusion - keeping our crazy dreams alive. The ad is generating a lot of positive buzz from supporters and controversy from those who just don't get it, no matter how many times and ways people of color and those who DO get it try to explain the meaning behind the powerful protest. So, dear closed minded racist people, here we go again! The protest was NEVER about the American flag. Stop holding on to that lie when the truth is in your face! Like the song from the movie Frozen, ""Let it Go!"" Stop spreading the lie that the protest is disrespectful to the military and veterans. Green Beret and NFL player Nate Boyer requested that Colin kneel out of respect. Historically, racist people prefer a lie over the truth and suppression over freedom for all. Well, the double standard is when non people of color feel unjustly wronged or someone who matters to them were unjustly wronged, hurt, or killed. Then, and only then, there is an out-cry, and it's time to take a stand to do what is right. Oh yeah, before I forget, please, I urge you to conduct your research to fact check the original version of the national anthem and you will discover the pro-slavery verse. The national anthem was never written for people of color. Now, if you think you will impact Nike sales and the strong efforts to shed more light to expose racism and the importance of activism, think again. People around the world from various ethnicities will continue to support Nike despite your opinion. If you feel like showing off racist youtube videos of you burning your Nike apparel, posting negative comments about Nike and/or Colin, and letting the world know that you no longer support Nike because you disagree with the Kaepernick contractual agreement, go ahead. ""Just Do It."" Do your racist thing to deliberately support wrong and live in denial that 1. racism and miscarriages of justice do not exist in America, and 2. police brutality and unjustified murders don't occur in this country. All said, Nike will continue to thrive, Colin will continue to stand up for what is right, and you will still be a racist living a lie."

The protest is there are too many cops out here who are still getting away with murder who are still beating people for no reason at all just because they can just because they wear a blue uniform. And remember this this is a social injustice it's not just blacks it's not just white it is people of this country who are being misused abused and killed by those who are there to Serve and Protect!

,358.0,0,2018-09-07T02:00:47Z,"Viconius Vortex I see your point. I would argue that athletes are the only ones in the arena expected to act a ""certain"" way during the national anthem. During the professional games that I have attended, there are a large number of people still talking, walking, etc during the anthem.  A lot of them are the same people that would argue that kneeling is a disrespect but ignore they're talking and other things. I'd also like to point out that athletes are millionaires because of the revenue their employer makes. We can't argue that the CEO, CFO, or whatever high position you'd name for Johnson and Johnson shouldn't have the right to speak out on certain things because we take our hard earned money and buy baby powder, Neutrogena, or Aveeno. Yet this is the stance many will take against athletes. I think the misrepresentation of the police has to do with the media and people not wanting to research the statistics of the issue. It's never been said that all cops are corrupt, racist, or employing brutal tactics on African Americans. But there is something to be said when mass school shooters like Dimitrios Pagourtzis or Nikolas Cruz are somehow peacefully taken into custody while many African Americans seem to be so threatening while sitting in their cars at traffic lights. The real question is what makes ""Kaepernick and those"" come off as over-privileged? Their money shouldn't equate to them being over-priviledged. They all worked for where they are same as most senior executives of prospering companies. Believe me, if they were just handing out NFL, NBA, MLB, and NHL contracts, there would be a lot of people in line receiving benefits that they hadn't necessarily earned. I enjoyed your thoughtful response. Again, it's a shame that out of all the comments for this video...more people are not interested in having an educated and genuine discussion. They much rather talk about burning their NIke possessions and stopping their support of Nike. It's sad that the sweat-shops Nike has been knowned to use didn't cause this type of uproar/merchandise burning. Just saying. :-)"

,360.0,0,2018-09-06T20:08:46Z,"rodfromms¬† That certainly would be a helpful, i.e. the real face of the cause. But there are some fundamental issues with the cause, namely the misrepresentation about the police. Instead, promote the idea that there should be NO police brutality then you have a start. The primary problem is the venue. Every player's entire career from youth to professional has a clearly defined role they are expected to play on and off the field. Playing any sport in America has ALWAYS included patriotic respect as a core element, and for the non-Americans out there, this is fact and not opinion. Unlike the 60's, the Flag and service (military & first responders) to the country is no longer a ""bad"" thing. Playing of the national anthem at the start of the game is seen as a ritual acknowledgement of those that serve/d the American Ideal and reaffirm the promise to build a better USA. The promise to make a better USA is a guiding principal that the average American can/does expect from their fellow citizens. The pure existence of these athletes is only as a result of the freedom and opportunities afforded by others sacrifice. They are not expected to deride that ritual of humility and respect. They are millionaires being exulted by average citizens who expect such behavior from their ""heroes"", a contract on national civility. There is plenty of time other than during the national anthem to promote a cause. They have plenty of time and money to do it after/between games too, and MANY of them do. Most Americans see the kneeling behavior as disrespectful to the fans and degrading to the players themselves. It doesn't matter what the cause is they are promoting, at that moment they are standing on the shoulders of giants and Americans expect humility in light of that fact. I didn't mean this to be a soap box, but the topic gets so skewed by media and opinion bating. Kaepernick and those that kneel come off as over-privileged people even to Americans."
,361.0,0,2018-09-06T04:45:55Z,"Viconius Vortex Do you think the protest would receive more open ears and understanding if it had the face of a person that's not a millionaire?

Wouldn't be too hard to get their pictures out there if that would cause people to listen.

,362.0,0,2018-09-06T04:23:58Z,"GLO GANG PABLO¬† I hear you. I don't agree with the taking of the knee, but feel he does have the right to do it. My problem is that his/movement has no tangible goals and the facts don't bear out when talking about the police. (There are bad cops just not as claimed.) Even that aside, the culture dictated the behavior at these games and it hasn't shifted like other recent cultural changes like gay marriage, multi sexuals etc. Because the core of the American Football fans still venerate the countries history and the sacrifices made to create and preserve it; disrespecting that core group won't make meaningful change. So, it's ill advised IMHO, and no amount of grandstanding or wearing pig/police socks at practice will gain any converts. In fact just the opposite.
For Nike, they've had a long storied past of sweatshop labor accusations occurring in Asia (from Asian nations too). Those have been quite of late having mostly been papered over with money and politicians. but this stirs it back up. But since outside the USA it's fashionable to pound on the big kid on the block, and Nike as a global corporation will benefit, at least in theory.
As for sacrifice. No, I don't think he has to be penniless and destitute. I think you're over compensating on his behalf. The fact is he simply isn't broke. This just makes him more of a millionaire and shows he and his movement can be bought at an individual level. This will enrage the core NFL fans too. He's asking a large group of people who spend hard earned money to abandon their principals and embrace his commitment to a cause in which they don't believe. It won't work, IMHO. Just like the rest of the world's sports fans, most are hard working people that spend their resources to enjoy life and don't need lectures by millionaires playing a game for entertainment. That angers up the blood."
,363.0,0,2018-09-06T01:44:16Z,"@Viconius Vortex I see your point in terms of how much he would have lost. It's not guaranteed he would have had millions but he would have been playing for several more years. & obviously would have more $ than he did if he didn't kneel. Secondly, when has Nike had a tarnished image and even IF they did, HOW would THIS be the move to fix it? Nike just resigned a new long term contract with the NFL, I'd say their image isn't tarnished.
And what you're expecting of a human man is unreasonable. It's sad, you would only call it a ""sacrifice"" if the man was living on minimum wage and donating every penny he made to charity.. You can't have a nice home and still make a difference with donations? He's doing what's right even if it's not a headline donation. i.e accepting the deal and donating the entire profit. side note: I'm willing to bet a percentage of these Nike proceeds will be donated."

It's the exact reason Nike invested in him. They think it will improve their bottom line, improve their tarnished image and gain them favor on the world market which care nothing for the NFL but love political strife in America. If he said, thank you and I'm giving these millions to ""your favorite charities here"" because they are more important than my new 10k sqft. home etc. That would help polish his tarnished nature. He's still saying do as I say and not as I do. He's far from robbed or sacrificed particularly compared to those he's denigrated.

 ""Idolatry"" and talk of these 2 separate things. Focus. His or anyone elses, views don't necessarily have to agree with you, but what he said, countless others have also said and have reasons to do so. Certain groups are the ones targeted, racially profiled, unarmed and shot at higher rates and wickedness gets off with ""I feared for my Life lies"". Others have put on the Realistic POC face masks and commit crimes and then a POC is Falsley accused and it was a WT man wearing the mask posing as Blk. But SOME people seem to want those real issues, and very recent, swooped under the rug. That just happened, but the news talks about a Nike endorsement??? It's sinister.
We are in the 11th hour, and this foolishness is the focus... When you die, where is your soul going? Stop being distracted and work out your Soul Salvation. Repent of Sin and Turn from Wickedness.

If he really cared, he would have stood up against police brutality for all people, instead he incited violence against police, made his protest about race, called cops slave patrol, wore socks depicting cops as pigs and endorsed Fidel Castro, an evil tyrant the us military uniform/flag worked very hard to liberate from power to free the people of Cuba from oppression. I see people saying american military has committed more war crimes than any nation and blah blah, thats not true and thats how you know they dont know what they are talking about. America has liberated more countries from evil, racist tyrants than any other country in the world, and is the reason the nazi party did not spread to the rest of the world.

He Was walking back to his dad's home in a quiet FL subdivision. Had Martin been walking thru gang turf he probably should have handled the situation differently if approached by a gang member questioning why he was on their turf. But now, again, you have changed the facts to support your position. Bottom line is there is no reason to believe, even using hindsight, that Martin was up to anything or for Martin to believe that Zimmerman had a gun and was a moment away from killing him. Those are the facts of that case."

I have black friends too and they get fed up with cops and the Zimmermans of the world asking ""what are you up to?; why are you here?, who are you?"", etc. You and Zimmerman assumed Martin was up to something when he deserved  the presumption that he wasn't doing anything wrong. That's what you don't get. I'm a white guy who has been around a long time, probably longer than you, and not once has a cop or anyone else ever ask me to explain who I was or what I was doing some place. That's the respect you haven't learned. FYI, you might want to google George Zimmerman to see his record after he killed Martin.

Otherwise how could you know that Martin ""jumped on a person that didn't lay a single hand on them""? The fact is Zimmerman was not an officer and had no authority to stop or  ask Martin, a minor, a damn thing. Zimmerman approached the kid after police told him to leave him alone, that's a fact. Juries sometimes convict innocent people and acquit guilty people: an acquittal is not a finding Zimmerman's actions in killing Martin were justified;. It just means that jury wasn't convinced either way. And since Martin was killed and Zimmerman didn't testify the jury had no direct evidence. It's pretty telling that you believe Zimmerman had no responsibility to show respect to Martin. You put 100% of the blame on the black minor who was just walking back to his dad's house.

So apparently Zimmerman ignored those instruction, confronted Martin and when the kid (a minor) felt threatened he defended himself and when Zimmerman saw an ass kicking in his future he pulled a gun and murdered an unarmed minor. You can spin the shit out of that story (in fact, you have) but what ever else happened Zimmerman confronted a minor after police told him to leave the kid alone. And you don't blame the grown ass man who was stalking a minor, you blame the unarmed minor who was doing nothing wrong until confronted by creepy ass ""Officer Zimmerman"". Unbelievable."

,484.0,0,2018-09-05T22:56:27Z,James Hewitt just like the rest of the people who share your views your too short sighted to even try and understand. They have been black people EXTREMELY ACTIVE in their communities to better it so that the crime decreases and the youth could go and better it themselves. So it‚Äôs not like me and other black people are ignorant to the fact that some of us kill each other we are perfectly aware of that reality. But what makes things worse is when your own government has a system in which black people largely do not benefit from. It is a fact that I cannot have my hair a certain way or wear certain clothes because it would make white people uncomfortable. It is remarkable how this has become such a big thing because someone is doing a peaceful silent protest to bring attention to certain matters and you all have the audacity to make it about something else that it was most certainly not about. Could you really tell me that Kapernick was not expressing his constitutional by kneeling during the anthem?

1340.0,,1,2018-09-05T05:07:10Z,"2018 Russia Investigation Current Tally:

Guilty By Trial: 
- Paul Manafort (Trump‚Äôs Political Consultant) (8 Charges) (10 Charges Mistrial)

Guilty By Federal Judge:
- Alex van der Zwann (Worked with Rick Gates and Paul Manafort) (1 Charge)

Plead Guilty:
- Michael Flynn (National Security Advisor) (1 Charge)
- Rick Gates (Trump‚Äôs Political Consultant) (2 Charges)
- Michael Cohen (Trump‚Äôs Personal Attorney/RNC Deputy Finance Chair) (8 Charges)
- George Papadopoulos (Member of the Foreign Policy Advisory Panel) (1 Charge)
- Samuel Patten (Associate of Paul Manafort and Cambridge Analytica) (1 Charge)

Plead Guilty (Wanted To, But Denied Guilty Plea):
- Paul Manafort (Tried getting guilty plea after his first trial (Found guilty on 8 charges while the 10 other charges are still ongoing). My opinion/guess is He was denied because Mueller‚Äôs team probably already knows what he was going to tell them

Recused:
- Jeff Sessions (Attorney General)

Granted Immunity:
- David Pecker (CEO of National Enquirer/Trump‚Äôs friend) (Pecker claims there is a safe of decades of damaging stories of Trump. Rachel Maddow touched on how the National Enquirer repeatedly put out anti Hillary cover stories. ‚ÄúControl the medium, control the message.‚Äù)
- Allen Weisselberg (CFO of Trump Organization)
- Andrew Miller (Roger Stone‚Äôs Aide)

Granted Immunity (Manafort Trial):
- Donna Duggan (Moody Insurance Worldwide Employee)
- Conor O'Brien (Former KWC employee)
- Cindy Laporta (Paul Manafort‚Äôs Accountant)
- James Brennan (Federal Savings Bank Mortgage Banker)
- Dennis Raico (Federal Savings Bank Mortgage Banker)

A. This investigation is ran by Democrats!
- President is Republican
- House is Republican majority
- Senate is Republican majority
- Rod Rosenstein is Republican appointed by George W. Bush, a Republican
- Robert Mueller is Republican appointed by George W. Bush, a Republican 

B. This doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with Russia!
- The investigation is still ongoing (We‚Äôre only 1.5 years into the Trump presidency. Watergate took 2 years.)
- Paul Manafort has another trial a separate trial in September. I wonder what that could be for?
- Michael Cohen said explicitly he has evidence that the Trump campaign conspired with the Russian government. Treason is a crime and a crime treated by capital punishment aka the death penalty.
- TRUMP'S Campaign manager, TRUMP'S National Security Advisor, TRUMP'S Member of the Foreign Policy Advisory Panel, TRUMP'S Political Consultant, and TRUMP'S Personal Attorney/RNC Deputy Finance Chair were all indicted. The TRUMP Organization CFO got an immunity deal. The National Enquirer CEO, TRUMP'S good friend, also got an immunity deal. AND THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH TRUMP? Everyone in he has surrounded himself has either flipped, found guilty by trial, found guilty by a federal judge, plead guilty, recused themselves from the Russia Investigation, or has been granted immunity.
- Why are you so quick to dismiss someone of possible crimes?

C. Cohen's Guilty Plea from the Justice Department states (Says he has evidence to prove):
https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/michael-cohen-pleads-guilty-manhattan-federal-court-eight-counts-including-criminal-tax

- ‚ÄúThe plea was entered followed the filing of an eight-count criminal information, which alleged that COHEN concealed more than $4 million in personal income from the IRS, made false statements to a federally-insured financial institution in connection with a $500,000 home equity loan, and, in 2016, caused $280,000 in payments to be made to SILENCE TWO WOMEN who otherwise planned to speak publicly about their alleged affairs with a PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, thereby intending to influence the 2016 presidential election.""

- ‚ÄúThe Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, as amended, Title 52, United States Code, Section 30101, et seq., (the ‚ÄúElection Act‚Äù), regulates the influence of money on politics.  At all relevant times, the Election Act set certain limitations and prohibitions, among them: (a) individual contributions to any PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, including expenditures coordinated with a candidate or his political committee, were limited to $2,700 per election, and PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES and their committees were prohibited from accepting contributions from individuals in excess of this limit; and (b) Corporations were prohibited from making contributions directly to presidential candidates, including expenditures coordinated with candidates or their committees, and candidates were prohibited from accepting corporate contributions.""

- ‚ÄúCOHEN caused and made the payments described herein in order to INFLUENCE the 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION.  In so doing, he coordinated with one or more members of the campaign, including through meetings and phone calls, about the fact, nature, and timing of the payments.  As a result of the payments solicited and made by COHEN, neither Woman-1 nor Woman-2 spoke to the press prior to the ELECTION.‚Äù


D. George Papadopoulos on Jeff Sessions and Russia:
- ‚ÄúWhile some in the room rebuffed George's offer, Mr. Trump nodded with approval and deferred to Mr. Sessions who appeared to like the idea and stated that the campaign should look into it‚Äù - Defense Attorneys for George Papadopoulos (Former Foreign Policy Adviser, who plead guilty in trying to set up a meeting between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin)

Here are the options:
Option #1: Everyone in Trump's inner circle, opponents of Trump, and anyone that speaks negatively of Trump is a liar, according to Trump? 
Option #2: Trump is a liar and a criminal."

Henry) that the union army, slaves and British soldiers to raze. The flag that was was so gallantly streaming was left flying after the confederate troops fled. The good old boy who inspired the anthem was boasting that after the combined efforts of the union army, slaves and the British, his confederate flag was still there the following morning.  Here‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt stand for the Nations anthem.......this is what is says about the efforts of the union soldiers, slaves fighting for freedom and the British (hirelings).

And where is that band who so vauntingly swore
That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion,
A home and a country should leave us no more!
Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution.
No refuge could save the hireling and slave'
From the terror of flight and the gloom of the grave:
And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave
O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave."

2.In an America where pedophiles watch our kids outside their schools and men with guns go in  kill our babies as they sit in class FOX NEWS would have its Trump viewers believe that Colin is attacking the nation by kneeling in protest.

Or is it political ideology that corrupts your judgement. No one is perfect. There was only one¬†perfect man in¬†history, and political ideology nailed him to a cross. President Trump (like all of¬†us)¬†is a flawed man, but he is¬† leading the USA¬†back to¬†Christian values.

Almighty God¬†has no time for the pious and proud¬†, he chooses fallen men¬†of true repentance for mighty missions, like the apostle Paul. When Christ came to deliver his gospel he didn't choose Pharisees for his disciples, he chose¬†sinful men. Peter¬†asked¬†Christ to leave him because he was a sinful man. The old testament is full of sinful leaders,¬†David, Solomon, Sampson, even Moses¬†did evil things, but God forgave them, and so do we. President Trump's past is irrelevant. He is serving the Lord today by restoring Christian values to this nation. Oh and speaking of the wicked and unrepentant Obama, why didn't he tell the nation that he is homosexual, that his wife is a transgender with a penis, that his children are adopted?¬†He now admits that he was born in Kenya.

After 8 years of the heathen Obama, we Christians prayed for an honest man to lead the nation with Christian values, and almighty God gave us president Trump who is doing just that.

Christians to be very careful with their comments about him. Of course to the godless media, it doesn‚Äôt matter, they are pretty much doomed anyway."

Racism is been used as a coverup tool to scare and intimidate people on the basis of race differences ‚Äî that is true racism. Look who are the ones always using this TOOL! Fear is an old tactic that is being used in our dishonest media to scare honest people into silence. That is what makes Mr. Trump so unique ‚Äî he won‚Äôt shut up. Everyone who has been intimidated into silence, found a mouth to speak for them. The Liberals don‚Äôt hate President Trump, they hate faith, morality, goodness and anything and anyone who dares to bring to light their evil interests. Everything was okay with Trump, when he was one of them, same with Ronald Reagan, but when they decided to stand up for what is decent and good, then they became undesirable! Victilism (those who uses a victim excuse) is very common in the mouths of those who have called anyone who opposes them as being racists. Hello true racists, your game is not working anymore. America folks are bright (those who have not been brainwashed yet) and they saw a good man (with an uncontrollable mouth) and put him in the white house in spite of our arrogant and snob media, Hollywood scum, dishonest politicians and off course ... the DemonRats. Anyone (of any race) who still using race as an excuse, who thinks the world (or anyone) owes them anything are just lazy bums that need to wake up and do something meaningful with their life. Success is the best medicine against ENTITLEMENT and Hard Work is the best tool for success. People who works hard NEVER have time to be a victim. Stop the insanity of blaming everyone else for your victim status. It is not the color of your skin that gives or takes your rights from you. It is your thinking that makes or breaks you! Grow up! Stop blaming others for your twisted thinking! Hope you do because America needs more hard workers and much less Entitlement bums."

I watched him all through college when he played for the Wolf Pack and he was and is AVERAGE. He wasn't even the best quarterback in the WAC conference. Colt Brennan absolutely crushed him in the stats and every head to head match up. He was lucky to play on a great 49ers team who's defense and running game were solid. Playing in the superbowl is not the same as winning one. How many quarterbacks who played and lost are even talked about today other than Marino and Kelly? Kaepernick's shitty baseball style throwing motion and lack of intelligence are why he's not on an NFL team. Only after he got benched for his horrible play did he start his meaningless protest. Now he has the excuse he always wanted to make up for his mediocrity.

,697.0,0,2018-09-13T22:15:11Z,Obviously I can't take you at your word. You havn't given up. You're still here going on and on and on saying the same things over and over again.
,698.0,0,2018-09-13T22:09:09Z,You obviously are unaware of the different standards. There is footage of lots of things some of it real some of it fake. I did deal with the issue at hand multiple times saying that the way he went about it was not the best way to do it. The fact that you are so blind that you can't see that tells me that you have trouble dealing with the facts.
,699.0,0,2018-09-13T21:36:56Z,"I did answer your question. It's not a double standard because the normal standard for the Anthem is to stand. To be knighted or to pray is kneeling. Different standards not double standards. Kapernick will be remembered by most as the guy that kneeled during the anthem, not the guy that raised awareness of police shootings. His efforts should have gone towards getting the police to work towards applying the law equally. https://townhall.com/columnists/larryelder/2018/09/13/nike-pays-kaepernick-to-push-peddle-false-harmful-narrative-of-police-brutality-n2518351?utm_source=thdaily&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=nl&newsletterad=&bcid=3bda3de330a31802756b7b3f186fcc1f"
,700.0,0,2018-09-13T11:44:56Z,@James One how do you know what they have a problem with? Do you speak for all of them? Just deal with what you know about. Plus their were no issues with it prior to Trump jumping on the band wagon.
,701.0,0,2018-09-13T11:43:08Z,"@James One the double standards are hilarious. There is footage of Trump singing whatever words came to him which aren't the right ones. He can't even say 'anonymous'.
He is the Commander in Chief. Anyway you fail to see these double standards and have a repost for everything, which doesn't deal with the issues at hand. You're obviously not open minded enough to have your views challenged nor strong enough to change them if someone points out their inconsistencies. I think that's a shame."
,702.0,0,2018-09-13T11:33:17Z,@James One thus logically and for consistency and based on your words; kneeling to your flag therefore shows service to the flag and your nation. Correct?
,703.0,0,2018-09-13T11:30:01Z,"@James One you have not answered my question as to why it is disrespectful when other forms of kneeling aren't. This is the double standard.
And shouldn't the law be enforced equally? He is raising the awareness that it is not. Who is he trying to get on his side by protesting in such a way? Are you trying to tell me that heads of law enforcement are going to start applying the law equally because of his protest? I don't think so. Thus he is not looking to win people over."
,704.0,0,2018-09-13T11:26:26Z,"There was already awareness of it. If you really want to get things done you need to do more than raise awareness, you have to get people involved."
,705.0,0,2018-09-13T11:23:12Z,"No where did I say you must stand. I said it is considered disrespectful by many. Once again you're mixed up. You don't have to sing the words. How do you know he doesn't know them? There have been times that people who've been hired to sing it before a game have forgotten the lyrics so maybe that happened to him. It's not a requirement. As I've mentioned several times there are better ways to raise awareness. They've no problem with him being a black man raising awareness, they've a problem with how he went about it but you obviously can't see that. Black men and women are given plenty of opportunity to speak in this country and they do on a regular basis. You seem obsessed with the confederate flag. Who says they're fine with it?"
,706.0,0,2018-09-13T11:03:59Z,"Many people consider it disrespectful. Veterans, families of veterans etc. Once again you don't know the difference on kneeling. Kneeling to God shows your service to God. As I've said many times he could have gone about it in other ways. He could have approached law enforcement with the media in tow to go over this situation and there were the other ways I mentioned before too. No he expects certain heads of law enforcement to enforce the law equally."
,707.0,0,2018-09-12T23:39:19Z,"@James One why do you think Kaepernick wants to get people on his side? He just wants to raise awareness of a problem. Most of us know know the specific targeting of people because of their colour is wrong [though some may disagree], so there is no need to win people over. That's not his aim. He's achieved what he has set out to do."
,708.0,0,2018-09-12T23:33:57Z,"@James One Show me where it says you must stand to your national anthem. Is it disrespectful not to sing the words? Trump doesn't even know them and he's your supposed leader. That's far more disrespectful. It's taking the piss to be honest. But hey ho; he's yours. 
We demonise our representatives for not knowing the words to our national anthem.
Again it's all smoke and mirrors simply to let people vent their true feelings. As I said before I wish they were just honest about it and say they don't like a black man raising awareness of inequality because he is black and that they are fine with white nationalists brandishing the confederate flag because they are white. Simple."
,709.0,0,2018-09-12T23:26:26Z,"@James One who says it's disrespectful? It's just a different way of showing allegiance perhaps. Perhaps he is showing respect to those gunned down by the Police. Is it disrespectful to kneel when you pray to God?
The double standards are all too obvious especially as Trump demands subjugation from the heads of various law enforcement agencies and judicial departments. Funny that; don't you think?"
,710.0,0,2018-09-12T19:18:43Z,"Where did you get that he's showing subjugation? Kneeling to the queen which is what subjects of the queen or a monarchy do, is different than kneeling during the national anthem which you are supposed to stand for. Not standing is considered disrespectful and therefore it offends many people. Offending people is not the best way to get them on your side. Actually I've found those that cry racist the loudest are the ones more so because they are redirecting and projecting their prejudices on others. Our experiences I'm sure differ. It is not racist to be wary of people that are different  because history has shown that it can be hazardous to ones well being to fully trust someone different at first. People do tend to side with those of their own because they're more comfortable with them and also more likely to share the same interests/beliefs etc. It is racist to deny them the same opportunities or to treat them differently or cruelly because of the differences. There is some degree of racism towards people of all colors."
,711.0,0,2018-09-12T17:49:07Z,"@James One as I said before everyone is s racist to some degree including myself. Those that deny it are the ones that are probably more so.
Anyway, you've not answered my question about Kaepernick showing subjugation to the the flag. I wonder why?"
,712.0,0,2018-09-12T17:40:35Z,"No, I do understand he is trying to make a point and as I pointed out before it's not the best way to go about it. Didn't you say people needed to be indignant to bring about change? People are already aware of what's going on. The media likes to keep it in the forefront and they've been doing so before Kapernick.  Good you bought Nike and you feel good about supporting a company that has sweat shops where they take advantage of people that they can pay lower wages too. That's the problem with too many people these days is they do what feels good instead of doing something that's actually right and that will be effective in solving the problem."

Both sides think they are right and they are.  However, the liberal movement is founded on hatred, half-truths, guilt and judgement.  They do not want to come to the table or resolve the issues.  They intentionally create issues like this to propagate and sustain hatred.  Unfortunately, there are just as many leaders on the conservative side who are sowing the same seeds of hatred and wrapping it in patriotism.  This is not a battle of right vs left, it is a war of right vs wrong.  Until the world learns to let go of the hate and take away the power of these people we all lose.  That is why we stand for our flag.  It is a symbol of one nation under God, indivisible, and only united we stand.  Divided, we fall.  The words Make America Great Again has nothing to do with the economy or politics but is a clarion call to all Americans to finally heal the divide that has devastated this country for over 200 years.  When we all learn to let go of hatred, we will realize that nobody is being force to kneel, but we are inviting one and all to stand together united as brothers.

1773.0,,13,2018-09-04T22:05:58Z,"To those who think it's ok to kneel during our National Anthem, let me ask you this one question, have you ever been to a Military Funeral? 

I am talking about a full Military Funeral where the soldiers are all wearing their Dress Uniform and carry the coffin of a veteran or soldier killed defending their Country to the grave site, and then the flag is folded up, followed by a 21 gun salute, and then finally the flag is given to the family of the veterans or soldier killed defending their Country.

I have taken part in one of these Military Funerals as one of the soldiers carrying the coffin and folding up the flag while I was still on Active Duty in the United States Army.

So to me when a rich NFL Player that has never served their Country takes a knee during the National Anthem I take it as very disrespectful to both Veterans and those that have died serving their Country.

And yes it's their right to do so, but it's very bad taste to do so and very disrespectful! 

These rich NFL players have the money and resources to protest at another time and everyone knows it!

,766.0,0,2018-09-05T14:55:06Z,"I have a question for you Mr. Warren. Have you ever been to a funeral of a 12 year old who was shot by cops for playing with a bb gun in the park?I am talking about a full family funeral where the mother, father, brothers, and sisters are in all black and carried a coffin of an innocent child who was killed by people who is suppose to protect and serve their country. NO flag is draped over his casket, no flag is given to the family, no 21 gun salute. I have taken part in a similar funeral and have seen this happen and not in a military setting but in my own neighborhood, and in case you are wondering I served our country as a Unite States Marine.So to me when a rich NFL player who has never served out country takes a knee because I fought for his right¬†for free speech¬†I take pride in knowing that what I'm fighting for is actually happening. I'm a veteran and I don't feel disrespected at all. I embrace that someone loves their country so much that they are willing to be hated by everyone because they want change. Patriotism is the love for ones country, its not standing for a flag, its not going to a bbq on¬†July 4th, its not paying taxes or working a job, its the love for your country and¬†having¬†the courage¬†to do what's necessary to see it become the best it can be. So, for Colin to love his country and to take a stand against American citizens being killed in he streets like animals, I commend him and will back him 100 percent. You are correct about it being their right to do so, just as it is your right to express yourself on this post but to label it as disrespectful is false because I don't feel disrespected at all and non of my military friends feel disrespected either so speak for yourself on the disrespect part. Question issue is more important to you, standing for the flag or unarmed people being killed for no reason? Simple question simple answer.""These rich NFL players have the money and resources to protest at another time and everyone knows it!"" - What is the purpose of a protest? To gain attention and bring awareness so why would they do it at another time or somewhere else when ALL eyes are on them? Quick example, when political officials are running for office don't they put up signs all around town, have people go door to door, call, send mail, etc. Why is that? It's to bring awareness and gain attention. If they hung their signs up in their own homes telling you to¬†VOTE how would anyone see them, how would anyone become aware of their intentions to run and become elected? Your suggestion that they should do it somewhere else or at another time is part of the larger problem of Americans trying to put these NFL players back in a box and silence them because its not what YOU want to see. I feel for people who can't see that AMERICANS are being killed point blank period. Always remember the flag doesn't make America great, the people do!

In most cases, the police officer isn't even fired much less criminally charged. Stephon Clark was unarmed in his own backyard when he was shot 20 times for God's sake. Any decent human being would be outraged. True conservatives should be opposed to giving the government carte blanche to execute citizens without trial.

I'm quite sure Nike is paying him more than minimum wage. This was a guy who was a one-year wonder... basically a bigger RGIII. Defenses figured him out and it showed. If he were a real, true NFL starting QB, a team would be looking past the assured pain in the ass having him on a roster would be. He already turned out a contract in Denver last year. The same time, the team where he'd fit perfect with a progressive left locker room (Seattle) said ""No, thanks."""

Man... I get what you‚Äôre saying. He could have still been playing and done whatever he wanted, however. Ask yourself this question... why do you think his agent didn‚Äôt want it coming out that he had an offer from Denver? 

He could have done both. That‚Äôs my point about it not being sacrifice. You can‚Äôt have it both ways if it‚Äôs really about sacrifice."
,829.0,0,2018-09-05T11:17:35Z,"@Nicholas Totoro that's the whole point and the sacrifice and stand he has made. He has given up something he loves for the benefit of others. Admittedly it is not the greatest sacrifice someone can make. We both know what that is. But it is a sacrifice, by definition, none the less. Time will tell if his expression of his constitutional rights generates the required results. But it certainly has made it a topic of huge debate which is a start."
,830.0,0,2018-09-05T10:58:57Z,"Jason Chinnian - There Was A Time 

You can‚Äôt have it both ways. He could have been in the league if he wanted and still done the things he wanted to do. Narcissism got him here because he turned down opportunity you‚Äôre saying he wanted, not a sense of sacrifice.

I may not agree with his protest or how he did it, but he has the right. That right doesn‚Äôt protect you from consequences. You say this is what he loves. He could have still been doing it and not given up a thing."
,831.0,0,2018-09-05T10:52:40Z,"@Nicholas Totoro of course it's a sacrifice. He's giving something up that he loves. Simple. Check the dictionary definition: Webster's or Oxford's. Plus, he wasn't to know Nike would come knocking on his door."
,832.0,0,2018-09-05T10:41:53Z,"Jason Chinnian - There Was A Time

,833.0,0,2018-09-05T10:27:40Z,@Nicholas Totoro his sacrifice is not playing football. The fact he turned an opportunity to play heightens that fact even more so.

He was a one-year wonder Option QB who bet on himself and lost by voiding his own contract in San Francisco. He had an offer from Denver last year and turned it down. He's still getting paid, likely more than a backup QB would. Where's the sacrifice? When you make a political stand on anything at all, right or wrong, you're mainly preaching to your choir."

The coded language of which you speak is called an educated mind. Are you aware that there were two major hurricanes that hit us before Irma hit Puerto Rico; Harvey in Texas, and Irma prior to PR? That's 3 hurricanes within a month! Our relief efforts were spread so thin, and STILL we managed to supply Puerto Rico with billions in food, water, FIMA, and medical supplies. Another known fact is that Puerto Rico was on the brink of filing for bankruptcy before the hurricane, because their government is a joke. Still' Trump was vilified as always. Democratic tax and welfare policies killed towns like Detroit, and Flint. The water crisis in Flint is a direct result of an inept Democratic system of government. Flint has had a Democrat for Mayor for over 40 years, and it has only gotten worse!  As for the kids in cages:  https://www.dailywire.com/news/31782/activists-spread-shocking-photo-immigrant-child-james-barrett       Yes, there are terrible cops out there. There are also terrible doctors out there. There are bad teachers out there. Are you going to stop going to the hospital, and taking your kid to school?  There needs to be more situations dealt with individually, instead if making blanket statements. I you see a cop abusing his authority, say something, and people will fight beside you. I WILL FIGHT BESIDE YOU. But if you just go around saying ""the system is racist"" that doesn't help anyone.  Taking a knee and raising a fist is the laziest form of activism. Meanwhile The Game meets with L.A. police chief to voice his concerns and talk things out, and everyone calls him an Uncle Tom and a traitor.  And why is it that after a Black man serves eight years as President, it's suddenly ""the death of democracy"" when a White man wins? Are you an inner-city kid?  You talk like one. I know, because i used to sound just like you. I used to believe there was some force within the system keeping me and my people down. I listened to all my friends who thought exactly the same as me, as we were fed all the same lies from the ratings hungry mainstream media. It took me leaving out on my own to break away from that self deprecating echo chamber.  I'm not trying to bring you to my side. I'm an independent. I'm only challenging you to stay away from mainstream media, who has no qualms about lying to you for ratings, and listen to some more conservative voices on the subjects that concern you.  You can start with The Amazing Lucas. He's a Black kid from the city of Chicago. He's funny as hell, and really breaks things down on a down to Earth level.  Before you dismiss this message, you should know that this is the longest message I've written on youtube.  It shows that i have faith enough in your intelligence to be able to seek the truth out on your own.  I don't fully trust Republicans, but if you do some research, you'll see that most cities riddled with crime, poverty, and unemployment have been long run by Democrats."

,987.0,0,2018-09-06T07:47:01Z,"+Real Talk I don't really care what you buy. The information is out there. He got fair offers for what he was worth. The man was damaged goods! Yes, he had 2 good seasons and made the superbowl. But the entire league figured his game out, his pattern, his motions. Before long, he lost games, and his starting position. This was before he began his farce of a protest! Also, why are you assuming I am Black? I am Puerto Rican. But even if I were a Black man, where does it say that i have to instantly support people I dislike, simply because they are Black?  The fact that you consider Kaepernick one of the most intelligent Black man you've ever seen tells me a lot about you. You're a person who seeks out heroes in athletes because your world does not range far beyond sports. There are real Black leaders out there, FAR more intelligent than Kaep, such as Larry Elder,  Condoleezza Rice, Deeneen Borelli, Charles Phillips, to name a few. But you don't care about them, because they don't toss a piece of inflated leather across a field.  As far as Trump goes; I'm not going to argue his taxes with someone who is too lazy to do the research. As for your ""McDonalds, KFC, dead vermin"" reference: as long as I keep on seeing more of my hard earned money in my paychecks, and he continues to make the safety and prosperity of the American people his first priority, I don't care if the guy eats out of the TRASH and walks around with a BEAR on his head!  Either a change of priorities is in order for you, my friend, or a change of your profile name. ""stupid talk"" seems like a better fit."

I don't buy that Kapp got a deal and if he did it was sub standard. His biggest deal will be when he wins a lawsuit from the league and their owners. Kapp will own their homes. LOL! It is pathetic as hell that you all can't even accept someone who is half YOUR race. Hence Obama and Kapp! They are the most intelligent black men I ever seen. And you settle for an elementary vocabulary having, itty bitty handed, dead vermin on the head wearing, orange spray on tan wearing, can't see his own Willie big gut, toddler tantrum throwing, mental patient who thinks McDonalds and KFL are elite cuisine. That is a clue he's not a billionaire. That is why he will never show the real tax returns. Those pitiful papers you claim he disclosed are FAKE NEWS!!!!!"

They buy in when the price is lower, and resell when he price bumps back up. The thing is that when smart investors rush in to buy the newly discounted stock, them purchasing stock actually raises he value of the stock again. I dont think you know how stocks work or capitalism for that matter. I wish I had money to invest right now, because it would all go to Nike tomorrow morning pre-market. Only a few Americans care about this whole flag thing enough to sell their Nike stocks. Europeans dont care, Asians dont care, Africans dont care, and most Americans dont care. And they will all buy the in on he 3% dip in share price, as any good investor should.

Btw, you think America is where Nike makes most of its money? Nike makes most of its money in Europe because of how big soccer is. A few racist clowns selling their Nikes stocks isnt gonna destroy Nike. Club soccer championships are about to restart or have retarted already. People will conti ue buying Nike.

He and so many others who do protest have the  right to air grievances without fear of retribution or censorship which is fundamental to democracy in America (so him being blackballed is literally violating his rights which is technically illegal). Or does that not count because he's black, well technically he's biracial but here in America y'all only see him as black because of the ""systems"" (country) racist ""one drop rule"" which further says that racism is systematic and institutionalized. But hey let's not go off of facts but ignorant opinion and views because he's shedding light on the treatment of some people within America."

I see nothing that can be done to fix social injustice. Has Kaepernick done anything to solve any issues? His actions so far seem to provoke than to help. It seems the only injustice done here was to Kaepernick and people want justice for him. 

If Kaepernick won his case, as judge I would only allow his victory if he gives all that money to charity of his choosing. Or any schools to help education and protection. And for players taking a knee. Have the camera record every player and make sure that anyone who does kneel must have 20 percent of their salary donated to a charity or school. And this is done each time they kneel. 

We will see how money will affect their loyalty to their cause."

Not my money!  They've gotten hit with many human rights law suits, but they just pay up and keep doing it!  A BETTER person for their ad and logo would have been a SOLDIER!!

He started knealing during the pre season when he realized that he wasnt good enough to beat out Blain Gabbert for the starting job so if the 49ers released him he could say it was because he was politically outspoken. The 49ers kept him to ride the bench(save for a few games) and paid him 14 million dollars tonbe one of lousier QBs in the league and we have found out this whole time Nike has been paying him and they just announced a multimillion dollar contract for him. He didnt sacrifice  his career as he was offered a contract by at least one team (The Broncos) he was on a steady regression until he was benched. Face it he was no longer good enough to be a starter and refused to take a pay cut to be a backup. No sacrifice at all.

U.S. Code¬†‚Ä∫¬†Title 4¬†‚Ä∫¬†Chapter 1¬†‚Ä∫ ¬ß 8

4 U.S. Code ¬ß 8 - Respect for flag

No disrespect should be shown to the flag of the United¬†States¬†of America; the flag should not be dipped to any¬†personor thing. Regimental colors, State flags, and organization or institutional flags are to be dipped as a mark of honor.

(a)

The flag should never be displayed with the union down, except as a signal of dire distress in instances of extreme danger to life or property.

(b)

The flag should never touch anything beneath it, such as the ground, the floor, water, or merchandise.

(c)

The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free.

(d)

The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery. It should never be festooned, drawn back, nor up, in folds, but always allowed to fall free. Bunting of blue, white, and red, always arranged with the blue above, the white in the middle, and the red below, should be used for covering a speaker‚Äôs desk, draping the front of the platform, and for decoration in general.

(e)

The flag should never be fastened, displayed, used, or stored in such a manner as to permit it to be easily torn, soiled, or damaged in any way.

(f)

The flag should never be used as a covering for a ceiling.

(g)

The flag should never have placed upon it, nor on any part of it, nor attached to it any mark, insignia, letter, word, figure, design, picture, or drawing of any nature.

(h)

The flag should never be used as a receptacle for receiving, holding, carrying, or delivering anything.

(i)

The flag should never be used for advertising purposes in any manner whatsoever. It should not be embroidered on such articles as cushions or handkerchiefs and the like, printed or otherwise impressed on paper napkins or boxes or anything that is designed for temporary use and discard. Advertising signs should not be fastened to a staff or halyard from which the flag is flown.

(j)

No part of the flag should ever be used as a costume or athletic uniform. However, a flag patch may be affixed to the uniform of military personnel, firemen, policemen, and members of patriotic organizations. The flag represents a living country and is itself considered a living thing. Therefore, the lapel flag pin being a replica, should be worn on the left lapel near the heart.

(k)

The flag, when it is in such condition that it is no longer a fitting emblem for display, should be destroyed in a dignified way, preferably by burning."

302.0,,0,2018-09-06T00:01:21Z,"Ok people, lets look at this once again. Colin Kapernick took a knee because of injustices, he sat down at first then a military veteran told him to take a knee and he did with no argument. It was a peaceful protest because of what the flag is supposed to stand for which it has never done since it's existence especially when race is involved and if you don't believe that then look how people are reacting. Our military  is not really ours, it's the government's. Therefore the government controls the military not the people. The respect comes from the people more than the government so what does that tell you especially when Kapernick respectively considered the veterans suggestion. I guess people are ok with injustices of course only when it doesn't happen to them. Honestly everyone who believes in our country, believes in the flag should be supportive to Kapernick but unfortunately they do not and it shows what people really want or think about this country, our rights, the constitution, bill of rights. Obviously none of that matters and they are going against everything this country is supposed to stand for, that seems very stupid and this is not an opinion it is a fact. The truth is evaded and lies our accepted. Makes no sense at all. Now just because Nike stick with Tiger, c'mon now. What tiger did is nowhere close to what Kapernick is doing. Tiger got caught doing bad things, Kapernick kneeled for the people, how does that make sense #GTFOOH#"

He is better than 95 percent of all backups and better than a quarter of the leagues starters. They make Jerseys for the NFL and they decided to stick it to the NFL for the I justice they are doing against Kaepernick. Poetic justice if you ask me. So you mean to tell me tho that because of Kaepernick being on Nikes campaign that people are being brainwashed enough by the media to actually rebel against Nike. Um. Doesnt matter either way because Nike makes the Jerseys For the NFL and the NBA so this isn't gonna really hurt Nike at all. They did the right thing by saying to the NFL if you are gonna blackball a person for speaking against our change for our society yet continue to go on not holding people to higher standards and letting all these injustices continue to happen, we dont agree with that and the week you have your season opener we are gonna drop this campaign to remind you that we help make your league part of what it is.

312.0,,0,2018-09-05T20:45:54Z,"Everyone who refers to the military in a Colin Kaepernick discussion missed the point and blatantly decided to follow a narrative to ignore a cause worthy of protest.  No NFL player kneeled to protest the flag, the military, or the anthem.  The media and others characterized the protest that way as a distraction.  Even if someone wanted to protest the anthem, I wouldn't be against it.  There are 27 amendments to the U.S. Constitutions, but zero changes to the Star Spangled Banner which still mentions slavery.  A soldier told Kaep to kneel if he wanted to protest honorably.  As a veteran of 3 wars myself, I have zero issues with the protest.  As a soldier who has been a part of numerous military funerals, I have on many occasions gotten down on 1 knee and presented a folded flag to the loved one of a deceased soldier.  This fake fury is truly upsetting.  Only 1% of the population are currently in the military.  Stop speaking for them."
,45.0,0,2018-09-06T22:29:17Z,"Colin's beliefs and my beliefs are different.  The manner in which he chooses to protest and the manner in which I would choose to protest would also be different.  When I comment to speak on his behalf it is mainly to discredit those who are trying to distract from his message of civil mistreatment in our country.  I know the specific reason why he is kneeling and am okay with it.  

If someone chose to kneel at a military funeral that is obviously a sign of disrespect because it isn't the time or place.  I know some would want to use that answer to prove a point but then that would show they don't understand the point of protest.  It would show people don't understand the unique power an athlete has to protest.  Protests need to be seen and heard to be effective.  When normal people protest they bring signs and chant slogans to be seen and heard.  People also register for permits so they can gather in a place where they know they can be seen.  A normal protest can be seen by hundreds or maybe thousands if they get some local news coverage.  A protest wouldn't get much positive attention at a funeral.  If it did get attention it wouldn't be positive or help a cause.  An NFL player kneeling is instantly witnessed by millions.  The only problem with kneeling as a form of protest is that it can't immediately transmit a message.  Others can derive a message that isn't coming from the protester.  The media has hijacked the message to lead people to believe the military, flag, and anthem are being protested.  Kneeling gained visibility needed for protest but failed at delivering the proper message.

I can speak for myself and I believe I am well spoken enough to protest in another form.  I wouldn't expect most athletes to be comfortable in more complicated forms of protest.  Colin is capable and people need to remember he hasn't taken a knee in over 2 years.  Media is keeping that narrative alive.

You are correct.  I did not protest while I was in the military, but I did not accept any unfair treatment for myself or soldiers while I was active.  I didn't just accept orders without thought, but I probably had more leeway since I was in intelligence.  Personally, I stand for the National Anthem.  If I need to protest, I have the means to do it in another way.  I just can't stand the people who are trying to change the narrative of someone's protest when they don't care about the issues being protested.
Colin is just one activist and he isn't the only one who is being treated unjustly while trying to protest.  If you have a problem with the Nike ad, that is just an opinion, but we still aren't talking about the police.  I just wrote 5 paragraphs without talking about the treatment we receive from the police which is the actual issue.  The media is winning.  We are constantly distracted from the actual issue."
,46.0,0,2018-09-06T19:56:44Z,"Something I gotta ask....like CK you have the freedom of speech, but how many times did you protest in uniform? Im guessing 0 times, although you have freedom of speech there are consequences to doing it in uniform. I too am a veteran and not even a fan of the NFL , but I do see where this is simply a business move (good or bad) I see so many ppl saying its not about the flag/veterans/military (its about his free speech!) and fail to recognize the injustices that have happened against ppl of color. The ad implies that he sacrificed everything.....his career? some ppl seem to think it was already over, when HE walked away, HE declined to accept less money than he thought he was worth, its been reported that he has been getting NIKE money since 2012, he is suing the NFL for his ""right"" to play, so where was the sacrifice??? For the record, if I find myself in the rare occasion of the national anthem I stand out of respect for other ppl, but I do not recite based on my beliefs. Something else I want to ask.....what if someone chose to kneel at a military funeral to protest (during military honors) Would you still support the protest? Another thought is you said a veteran told him to kneel like that guy spoke for all veterans, and yet you tell other ppl to stop speaking for them????? Or do you have to be on active duty to have an opinion?"

And it is about Colin. Not about business. It is about the injustice and not just about business. We will never need you to buy nike. They don't ever need you. Never will. You're nobody.

But I really can't respect a company or anyone who helps push a false narrative like Colin Kaepernick's or the hands up don't shoot BS. The vast majority of that garbage is hoax. And the problem is when it gets pushed hard enough people end up dead over it. Also don't respect for Nike trying to make column look like he gave up everything for the sake of his principles... He didn't. He's still a multi-millionaire who is mad because he got benched and then decided to start protesting for social justice... It's a joke.

The NFL is a business and he chose to lower his value by making polarizing political statements on national tv. Yes, he was passed up by most NFL teams but it's not like he sacrificed ""everything."" He still received interest from a few teams and was close to being signed by the Ravens until his girlfriend essentially called Ray Lewis an uncle tom on twitter. IIRC he actually turned down an offer saying it was too low; he wanted at least $10 million.

And you don't speak for Kap, so you don't know whether the man cares or not, the fact of the matter is he cared enough to do what he did. And if you really think things are the same as it was in 1965, then you are truly misguided. Change in civilizations take time, because you are dealing with millions of people, as shown throughout history. Let alone you generalize all white people.

Another thing, you keep using the term athlete as if it validates your argument. As if no athlete cannot think or care for others because of the amount of money that they make. As if they own experiences mean nothing, such as the case with Sterling Brown, an NBA rookie who was tased and arrested for all the wrong reasons. With the Milwaukee Police Chief saying three weeks later, that the officers acted ""inappropriately.""

Politicians, cooks, police officers, drivers, pilots, etc. All have plenty of incompetent people that fell through the cracks, and with enough power and authority it is certainly detrimental to people's quality of life, but if we judge every workforce by its worst employees, or every man by his worst act, then no group puts out quality work, and no man does anything morally praiseworthy.

Likewise with boxing-related products, which Manny is only a good get for the Filipino market. Kaepernick is likely only marketable to the fools willing to lower their standards and look ANYWHERE for their next Ali. I would also want to know what the nature of his deal with them is.

He was on his radio talking to the box about the game and just blew off the Anthem because the game was more important.  The campaign took hold because so many people are wanting to be rebellious.

Woodrow Wilson implemented segregation at a federal level, and the KKK was aligned with the Democratic party. When the Democratic party finally lost their 150 or so year battle to destroy black lives after the Republicans passed the civil rights act, they decided to go after the black vote co-opting black Americans and plunging their communities into crime, poverty, incarceration and broken families.

113.0,,0,2020-06-07T00:14:09Z,"I stopped listening to the video after this YouTuber missed the most important piece of the puzzle.   Why he knelt instead of sitting.   

This YouTuber skipped over it a lot.

Why when we talk about Colin Kaepernick, we talk about what he wants us to take about, him playing in the NFL or he sacrificed something.

Why aren't we talking about the protest, rallies, marches Kaepernick's never conducted nor been a part of?

Okay, he shouldn't have to do that because he donated money to some organizations. But why not vigorously speak to local, up to national officials.  Where are the meetings with city council members, Senators, either of the President (Obana or Trump), Governors, Mayors, Chiefs of Law enforcement,  etc?  Where are they?

Why is HE hiding behind a retweet, when he DID NOT KNEEL against police brutality.   He knelt because a White man,  Nate Boyer (Ex-military and Ex-NFL player), told Kaepernick to kneel TO RESPECT THE MILITARY.

115.0,,0,2020-06-06T18:04:03Z,I stopped watching the NFL due to this. Colin Kaepernick was denied his 1st amendment rights and suffered to continue his beliefs. His beliefs hurt no one and it brought to light the injustices done to people of color in America when all America wants to do is sweep its mistakes and sins under a carpet. This country loves keeping minorities at bay and preventing them from opportunities. We are forced to act like wars is a great American past time and a tribute to our country yet the wars bring more economic and social ruin to this country. Now attacking people of color has been a military and local police past time. They put a knee on someone's neck while putting their hands in their pockets. People die right on camera; their souls slipping away. And we are not paying tribute to BLM and Colin Kaepernick.

After Kaepernick donates money to legal funds for some protestors, that initiative will prompt people to give back money lost and more into his pockets,  to do what character build. 

For me, the real work is grassroots.   Kaepernick knelt on grass, but got back up to talk about Fidel Castro as a positive image to the police brutality. When in truth, Fidel Castro did to Cuban people as US Police have done to Black people. I can go on and on, but wake up.

Okay, he shouldn't have to do that because he donated money to some organizations. But why not vigorously speak to local, up to national officials.  Where are the meetings with city council members, Senators, either of the President (Obana or Trump), Governors, Mayors, Chiefs of Law enforcement,  etc?  Where are they?

In a recent conversation w/my future potential ex son in law who agreed w/it I found out one of the reasons why. It turns out that a number of the younger generation mistakenly see the flag as a representation of our government instead of ""We the people"". I find this fact to be somewhat disturbing due to its implications. IMHO it can be directly attributed to the wavering of teaching our children about our history & the importance of all the flag represents i.e. the constitution, bill of rights, & the freedoms established by these documents & our founding fathers. I'm especially concerned about what the effect the discontinuation of saying the pledge of allegiance in our public schools is going to have on the latest generation of americans. It's apparent to me that the same powers colin kaepernick was protesting are well on their way to succeeding at undermining the solidarity of the american people which is the equivalent of having the enemy breach the walls of a fort.  America & the american way of life are truly under siege & we're on the verge of loosening the war. As an american patriot not only do I find kaepernick's original act offensive, but more importantly, the implication that it might be to late to do anything to stop it scares the hell out of me."

216.0,,2,2019-09-01T19:03:19Z,"To: JayZ. When (you) JayZ betrayed the (social justice agenda) 
Anti-Police Brutality Movement, you did so with all the 'grace' of a 
Benedict Arnold drunk on his own arrogance. There is nothing clever 
about filling one's hypocritical mouth with (wannabe) bougie 
catch-phrases like 'actionable item(s)'. What about far simpler 
concepts, like: ""police brutality"", ""murder-by-police"", and ""police-gang
 assault""? It is impossible to undermine a Movement and yet be 
pro-Movement, so your brand, JayZ, is anti-social justice. You did what 
you did to undermine Colin Kaepernick et al. taking a knee during the 
National Anthem, because had you not undermined these, American and 
global corporations would have become responsive to The Kneel. JayZ 
violated the 'birth' of a social justice Movement that was gaining 
momentum. The kneel was a passive nonviolent resistance tactic. If MLK 
were alive today, would JayZ still have done what he did? If he had, 
rest assured he would have been excoriated by The Movement- if not by 
Dr. King himself. What this should prove to we, the public, is which 
side of the Police Brutality Issue JayZ stands on. And, we should take 
note that JayZ did not only fail to stand alongside black men who took a
 (very public) stand against Police Abuse, he failed to stand alongside 
black men who took a (very public) stand against Police Brutality WHILE 
THEY WERE ON THEIR JOB! So, despite what JayZ claims, it is germane, to 
we the public, that CK (once) had a job: a very important and 
high-profile job! Just like it was important to Dr. King that the 
sanitation department workers in Memphis had jobs. Hence, JayZ actually 
took a stand alongside the NFL: an Oppressor. Didn't this type of 
bull-ish happen during slavery times? Isn't JayZ from the same New York 
City that Eric Garner was from? Why did JayZ take a position that gave 
himself the image of kneeling to the whim of a (corrupt) Establishment? I
 am no longer a (thought-full) JayZ 'fan'. I think he needs to go and 
listen to ""The Story Of OJ"", on repeat, a few times. It is one thing to 
try and make money for one's self and/or one's family. It is yet another
 thing to be greedy. It is yet another thing altogether to be a (race) 
traitor. And it is still yet another thing, entirely, to undermine 
(an)other black men's Initiative. JayZ, you are not only a business, 
man; you are a renegade. So we, The Movement, 'gets no love' from you? 
No, thank you, son. We don't want none (any). We want CK playing in the 
NFL, again- still kneeling if he wishes to- and, for you not to be in 
the crowded stadium when that happens."

Yes, the minority are discriminated against. If you got the wallet, you got the privilege. Wealthy Black do have it better than poor white, and yes everybody has it better than poor black. It's ridiculous, but if the level of the poor got thinner, and crime went down it would start to appear that discrimination gets lower. The media loves it and that's part of the fuse for this anger level. 
The minority will stick out more. If I go to Hati and commit a crime, ""White"" will be the headline. I'm a minority for being white and middle class.
No offense to Hatti. Beautiful country, but 6 million live below poverty. Is my white well to do ass going to get hugs? 
However, one thing I think the US and Hati have in common. Majority of both countries populations are not racist and don't discriminate. But the media and extremist don't want that getting out.

238.0,,1,2019-07-12T06:48:52Z,"m a hardcore 9ers fan, and I still haven't gotten over the decision for Alex Smith to lose his job (to Kap) due to injury.  I have little doubt that we would have won at least one Superbowl (maybe 2 if Harbaugh didn't ""go with his guy"" in 2012).  I personally never believed that he was ""the guy"".  His style of play, unless you're a freak of football intelligence and athleticism, like DeShaun Watson or Russell Wilson, isn't sustainable in the NFL.   It looks great to the layperson on film.  A cannon for an arm.  Legs like a gazelle.  But, unfortunately, the mind of Al Sharpton....  Which leads me to Kap's subsequent career.  It's blatantly simple.  There was never any league-wide conspiracy.  Kap simply made himself an extremely un-patriotic and controversial figure.  That, coupled with his highly questionable accuracy and football IQ, lead to no NFL team being willing to hire a a B-rated number 2 QB, who was guaranteed to be a media distraction.   Any GM and/or head coach willing to sign up for Kap's baggage would have to be completely moronic or extremely desperate.   So, Kap willingly created his own situation.   He may not have been smart enough to know what the full career implications would be, but whose fault is that?  Then, instead of stepping away from his SJW life and focusing on football, he consciously decided to go all in, as though he was the ultimate example of oppression.  He'll never play football again, but it worked out quite well.  Apparently, he runs Nike now.  I'm sure his adopted white parents couldn't be more proud of the son they raised.  He brings the message of fake virtuosity to the entire world.  The slave labor who makes his shoes can at least take solice in seeing pics of Kap wearing all black leather and a ""hey look at my blackness"" aftro.   Talk about inspiration...   If only, Harbaugh wasn't so self-centered...  The 9ers could have another Superbowl and the world might not have to see or hear from Colin Kaepernick."

369.0,,0,2018-09-16T21:19:46Z,"Hello there, idiots of the internet, that includes you, Donald Trump. The majority of us disrespect the American Flag on an annual basis. Guess what it's called. Drum roll, please.....FOURTH OF JULY. You'd think that it's patriotic to buy disposable dining instruments that have the flag printed on it to put your barbecued weiners on. Same with your apparel that has the flag on it. For example, bikinis, swim trunks, shirts, skirts, etc. But actually, it's disrespectful. (Ask Google if you don't believe me.) So no, you can't go off and criticize others for kneeling during the national anthem because they want to exercise their first amendment rights. His protest and disrespecting the Veterans of the US are two separate things. Trump, get this through your brain, please. I'd be more than happy to give you a lecture on how many times you made unforgivable statements in your tweets fifty times a day. I mean, you're doing well with the Trade War against China, which I agree with completely. Don't get me wrong, China deserves it. But, Nike supporting Kaepernick seems like a pretty reasonable move to make an impression now that we might smile at in the future. Emphasis on might. I mean, if you're going to boycott Nike, don't cut their logo off of your clothing. Just be a decent person, or half decent, and donate it. Someone less fortunate than your toddler like self will appreciate it greatly. The other option is to not even wear your Nike gear and keep it in the back of your closet.  Destroying their products doesn't get the point across. Especially when you're still going to use it afterward. Or when a person burns their shoes...you're an idiot for burning a shoe that might be worth hundreds of dollars. Oh and Converse? That's a Nike Company, you idiot. It's a classic choice for casual apparel and you now have a few choices of footwear that are casual and decent looking. Good job.

---

P.S. 

Don't go off about disrespecting the country when some are doing it..a lot. A protest against police brutality has nothing to do with disrespecting the country we all know and love. There shouldn't be a choice between a favorite sport and your country. Same goes for apparel. If the management of the NFL bothers you, express yourself in a way that will get their attention. But since it is a controversial issue, I think the NFL should reconsider what they did to Mr. Kaepernick. Especially since his beliefs and practices should have no impact on whether or not you should sign a contract with him. 

Ignorance is not a bliss at the moment. It's a sign that you are not trying to walk in other people's shoes like you were taught to in elementary/primary school. To dumb it down, you're supposed to see the issues from all sides of the argument. Not just one side or the side you agree with. If you want to see all the biases about this issue, read as many news articles revolving around the issue. Then, you can do what an educated person would do. Evaluate all sides of the argument and choose your side.

373.0,,1,2018-09-16T03:36:22Z,"So my understanding is, Colin Kaepernick, is the ""American"" football star who started the ‚Äútake a knee‚Äù national anthem protest against police brutality and has been named as the new face of Nike‚Äôs ‚ÄúJust Do It‚Äù campaign for its 30th anniversary.

The logic and rational doesn't make sense, it's actually backwards? 

In football you were taught to take a knee when a player was injured to honor them and in hopes that they will be ok from their serious injury. He is protesting with a gesture used in football ""to honor and respect"" someone who is injured? That seems to be a gesture in honor of police brutality a revearse of protesting?

¬†He is bieng a disrespectful American to the National Anthem where poeple are asked to stand for the National Anthem to ""honor"" America and our brave solders who sacrifice their lives for the freedoms we all enjoy, including him. Like the National Anthem says, "" the land of the free and the home of the brave.""¬† 

The National Anthem represents America a United poeple that fought for thier independence and earned our freedoms. His actions disrespects that meaning and only looks to divide poeple. If that's the kind of poeple and character Nike wants for their face, I will not buy any of their shoes anymore, just like I don't watch football anymore.

It seems the man is honoring police brutality and a disrespectfull American to our solders sacrifices that got the freedoms for our country. He is a divider not a uniter.

We are supposed to be one Nation under God!

And God says:

Isaiah 5:20 

20 Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!

Colin Kaepernick is reversing what was meant for honor as protest! Some Poeple look at him as good when what he is doing is bad.

Look at what our society has become, pretty much fits these paragraphs below.

Romans 1 :28-32 
28 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a reprobate mind, to do those things which are not convenient;

29 Being filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, debate, deceit, malignity; whisperers,

30 Backbiters, haters of God, despiteful, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,

31 Without understanding, covenantbreakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful:

32 Who knowing the judgment of God, that they which commit such things are worthy of death, not only do the same, but have pleasure in them that do them."

When you call a cop bad, whats the standard you comparing them to? Chief wiggums? What is he comparing a good cop to when he wants them to be good? RoboCop? He never gave a standard that he would like cops to work towards or away from. Plus there's a lot of other things wrong with this that I could go on all day about.

How would you know that a $20 bill from America is counterfeit unless you had a real $20 bill from America to compare it to? You have to have a standard. There was standard that he gave and I agreed with him on it was that they get paid leave after a shooting. That's not right and it needs to change.

The unemployment rate among blacks and other colored minorities have dropped ever since Trump is elected. Why is that? Because he wants ALL Americans to succeed, the people of color are just part of ALL. There are racists out there, and they're idiots, but they will never die out, racism is indestructible, and while we can try our best to try and reduce the number of racial bigots, it's a battle we'll never win. So Trump says to hell with it, we need to focus on other things such as jobs and produce functioning factories (well as many as necessary). And he so hates these protests because he feels like they're disrespecting the flag. I can't blame anyone who feels that way. It certainly seems so, but even if it isn't at all the case, which it very well may not be, why do it against the anthem. Why against the flag? Colin said it himself, who won't stand up for a country that oppresses black people. So why doesn't he go after countries such as England or Italy (I'm Italian so it kind of hurts to admit that)? I understand he's upset, and I understand there's still a lot of racism especially towards people of color today, but to blame the country as a whole is so wrong. And during a football game? I don't know if you know this, but I don't watch or go to a football game to see a demonstration or hear about one. I go or see it to see a game of people tackling each other for a ball (as wrong as that sounds). Point is, all these hashtags and trends don't belong in the NFL or any other sport league. Whether it's political or anti-bullying, I don't want to hear it. I watch football to get away from those things, whatever stuff I go through the rest of time, I want to forget it, turn on the TV and enjoy three hour of my life I'm never getting back. So yeah, this country ain't perfect. None of them are. We all suck. But what protesters sometimes do is forget what flaws they have. Anyone who protests in the US is lucky to be here, because they wouldn't get the same response as any other country would give them. And then they bash Trump who disagrees with it? He has freedom of speech too you know! Not everything he says is smart or even something any other person would say, but he has every right. He's not waving a Confederate flag around, he just hates when his country's flag is torn apart, because this country represents him and all the people that he serves for 4-8 years. This is already a long argument, and for a just a few word comment, so I'll just end it with this: there's so much more than anyone could ever think of. Racism will go on forever. You can't fight something you can't beat. We've already lost."

My family is insanely diverse! (In the best way imaginable üòâ)
Our Christmas pictures with the WHOLE family....They are something else! In one picture you'll see skin tones from the whitest of white to the darkest Chocolate browns and everything in between. Let me tell you....it truly is stunning in a way that is nearly indescribable. I consider myself to be so incredibly blessed to have been given the gift that I call my family. 

So, I think there is reason to hope that the world we want to live in can become our reality. And I think that the kind of conversation you and I have had, one where all parties are treated with civility and respect, is the key to achieving that reality. 
Which I why I wish that Kaepernick had never brought race into the conversation. Just think, if he had chosen that route, the national conversations taking place wouldn't be about black vs white statistics & ratios...it would be about reforming & changing police policies, training, and technologies so that NO person is wrongfully killed or mistreated."

This Nike thing is as much ""anti Trump"" as it is ""pro Kaepernick "". People hate Trump as much as others love Kaepernick so win win for Nike/Kaepernick team. Take Trump out of this and what you have is a guy that might mean well (Kaepernick) and a company exploiting the situation both socially and politically.  My biggest issue with Kaepernick is not his message ( although very skewed and not fully factual) but the method of blatantly disrespecting of country and the paying customers. Most people upset do not go out of there qay to show appreciation for the flag but they dont intentionally disrespect it either. Every generation gets closer to living up to "" all men are created equal"" . My generation is better than my parents and my kids ( I think) are barely even aware of color.

,337.0,0,2018-09-10T08:40:50Z,"jack johnson I'm in favour of making use of countries where employment opportunities are so scarce that an ethical sweatshop will make a significant positive change to the community (no children, no outrageous hours worked, protected staff, and a fair wage). 

They can change the cycle of poverty, especially for 3rd would countries where the dollar is very favourable, and the government has failed to transform the country. 

I am NOT in favour of the majority of sweatshops as they trap children into a permanent cycle of poverty, abuse, and human rights violations. 

My acceptance of the need for sweatshops is highly conditional. It HAS to benefit the individuals, the community and the corporation. It must apply western work standards to ensure ethical treatment of the people and the environment."
,338.0,0,2018-09-10T07:09:40Z,so what ur saying is ur in favor of sweatshop products?
,339.0,0,2018-09-10T05:45:44Z,"kommisar While I agree that it is a completely different environment and economy to what the Westernized countries have, there are some areas that could be debated. 

On the extreme end of the sweatshop crimes are children as young as 5 years old, earning a few cents an hour, and working 100 hours a week. 

The extreme hours with low pay that children are often forced into (what child would volunteer for this?), also means that  these children never receive an education, and the family only ever subsists and never breaks the perpetual cycle of poverty. 

On the other side there are some more ethical sweatshops which pay far better wages and the families are able to develop themselves beyond just mere hand to mouth subsistence. 

There is evidence to support the necessary evil of ethical sweatshop in the industrialisation of a country. Indeed it wasn't that long ago that cheap labour helped transform many economies that we know today. 

I would argue that if a low but fair wage were paid ( for that economy), children under 14 were not used, and the workers were protected from rape and extreme 100 week hours, or punishing shifts of 72 hours in a single stretch, the suffering of a single generation could be radically transformed for the benefit of the coming generations. 

However, as many sweatshops have continued to exist with abysmal circumstance for the worker over generations, there is evidence that a harsh exploitation is beneficial only to the company/government. THESE are the ones that we should be aware of and stop supporting until they can add vakue to the community development. 

Nike/Jordan have cleaned up their act significantly but as recently as 2017 human rights violations were found in Honduras and Cambodia."

,343.0,0,2018-09-09T15:03:07Z,"@Leevy where are you finding your statistics that black people are 3 times more likely to be shot by police? 
All official documentation & records (from local precincts to the FBI) all point to the exact opposite. 
For instance, in 2017, 457 white people were killed by police vs 223 for black people. (Hispanics accounted for 179)
So far in 2018, the numbers are very similar: 211 white people, 102 black people, and 68 Hispanics, have been killed by officers. 
Considering this, the fact that black people shoot officers in much, much higher ratios, becomes a lot more alarming because the cause & correlation you spoke of disappears. 
I am all for any person's right to peaceful protest & assembly and I wouldn't deter anyone from bringing attention to a cause that deeply matters to them, but when people, especially those that are high profile like Kapernick, lead people to believe things that aren't true, this helps no one & furthers the divide between officers & civilians and pits Americans against Americans. 
At the end of the day, who does this help? 
With all that being said, I ABSOLUTELY AGREE that there are WAY too many instances of officers shooting unarmed  civilians- of all colors & backgrounds. 
I believe Kapernick's demonstrations would have been a lot more effective, and garnered a lot more support, if HE hadn't made it about race. THAT is my point. 
I WANT us to come together & find a solution. I pray that it happens sooner rather than later. But until we stop making everything about race, sex, social status, ect. and start seeing everyone as HUMAN BEINGS, we will continue to see things decline. 

I Thank you for the civil discussion. I feel it has been enlightening & hope you do as well. God Bless."

NIKE IS NOT ONLY A BLACK COMPANY, BUT THEY HAVE GIVEN JORDAN AND LEBRON LIFETIME BILLION DOLLAR DEALS.

The act of sacrifice doesn't just have to be seen as an act of service in the line of duty as a service person. But rather the willingness to do something by any good citizen regardless of how big or small it is but if its a step to make a better tomorrow that's sacrifice. You may sacrifice for your family, for your children, for a friend, for a community, or even for a stranger an act of love and peace so that an issue can be addressed or for liberation and unity or just giving an helping hand that's sacrifice. The sacrifice of war has its share of debate. Justice doesn't not discriminate against which side we are on. The Nike ad speaks volumes of the global brand it is. Colin believed in something and acted peacefully. Nike motivated the world by empowering peoples of all walks of life, race, culture and creed. All athletes, athletes of special abilities, people who don't feel beautiful and wanna drop some kilos, people who may be battling cancers, mental illness, depression oppression, suppression. To just believe and keep believeing and do whatever it takes to succeed, and to make it happen in ones life whatever it is....Just Do it..Peace and Love..God bless NIKE."

By his silent protest, the only thing he accomplished was pissing off a number of people and then striking a sizable Nike deal worth a lot of money. He had every right to protest, but the basis of his protest was misguided and false. I think most of us would agree that there is a big issue with unjust police force, but to push the false narrative that it is directly aimed at African Americans because of some widespread racism in our police force is just simply not true. It also steers away from the much bigger problem of intraracial gun violence within our inner cities.

Trump, also, doesn't respect the Constitutional rights of Americans, once he disagrees with the action an individual chooses to make.

Also, race, and who is involved, plays a key role, towards fueling Trump's attitude in either a positive or a negative way. Re the anthem/kneeling issue, I bet, that, if it were Tom Brady, who, did what Colin Kapernick did, Trump's attitude would be much different.

Whenever black athletes are involved, if Trump doesn't like the athlete - because the latter may have, publicly, criticized him - and/or if Trump doesn't like a particular stance taken by that athlete, Trump will treat that person with gross direspect.

Trump called the NFL athletes, who, kneeled, ""SOBs"", and shouted, ""Fire them!""...He, also, said if they don't want to stand, they should leave the country.

Last, Trumpeachment is on its way and, for, that, to happen soon, many are kneeling in prayer."

To me thats not enough evidence. What I am looking for is the number or percentage of minorities that are UNJUSTLY killed by cops. In other words cases where the cops are #1 white #2 they killed a minority #3 (Most importantly) the cop was FOUND GUILTY in the court of law by UNJUSTLY killing a minority #4 the percentage of #3 between whites & minorities. If someone can provide me with those statistics from a reliable source that would be the concrete evidence I need. Thanks!"
,16.0,0,2018-09-14T08:37:47Z,"Richard Lewis,
You will never find those numbers.  In order for a LEO to be convicted of an unjustified homicide, the DA for the jurisdiction would first have to charge him (or her) with the crime and convict him in Court.  But in virtually all cases of a LEO using deadly force resulting in the death of a suspect, the incident would first have to be reviewed by the LEO's own Dept.  Not surprisingly, it's very, very seldom that a Review Board will find that a shooting by one of their own people was unjustified.  In which case, the DA would have virtually NO chance of getting a conviction in Court.

It's true that we civilians are protected by those men and women in Law Enforcement who are that 'thin blue line' between order and chaos.  It's also true that, in most cases, the 'blue wall' they form to protect their own - even when guilty - is almost impenetrable!"

I don't see them putting their lives on the line dodging bullets,let them put on a uniform and go learn what real sacrifice is and then they will meet real HERO's. I'm completely sure it was well before my time but I don't know of Martin Luther King jr.burning any American flags,he did however but his life on the line for a very just cause and paid the ultimate sacrifice and he didn't get paid millions to do it. bottom line Nike is all about the money period it's sickening.  us military personnel don't make millions but there is never a shortage of willing volunteers to go fight for America,knowingly going in what they are sacrificing, yet do it anyways wonder why that is? people like Nike and Kaepernick will never understand that and should be ashamed of themselves, making money on the sacrifices of the true HERO's that line cemeteries at Arlington and all throughout this great land.if this was what America really stood for id be ashamed to call myself an American!!!"

To anyone paying attention the dude is clearly an anti-american socialist while being more privileged than 99.99% of people in the country. He praises Castro and Malcom X while not standing for the US flag or anthem and donning socks depicting cops as pigs. He calls attention to an issue that‚Äôs not a real priority, and by that I mean it‚Äôs an significant issue facing the black community on a statistical basis, yet it gets you a lot of praise from people who operate off emotion over fact, and that‚Äôs the majority of people unfortunately. Imagine he made all this fuss over the epidemic of black on black crime? Our community engages in killing each other at alarming rates, more that any other racial group, a real issue that should be prioritized over the few unarmed black suspects shot by police each year, you have a better chance of being struck by lightning than being shot or injured by a cop... Instead of calling out this bullshit we put him up on the same plane as Ali, a real civil rights hero who stood up at a time when real injustices were occurring."

From a sports sociological point of view, it makes sense. It makes twisted sense because it is an opportune moment for the masses to gather, via tv or in large crowds, to engage in some form of nationlistic fervor. 
A ferver with a high probability in which the masses can perpetuate a sense of worship to the state, and to embody the ideals of the state sponsored agenda. 
Granted, other countries seem to engage in the same behavior but why should we?
Why do we have the need to fuse party rituals plus politics and intertwined them with sports?
I understand the reasons why but it seems that this is lost to a large percentage of our population. Few people can honestly sit down and ponder why that is it appears."

405.0,,0,2018-09-09T21:24:39Z,"These aren‚Äôt my words, I saw this post on another page, but thought I‚Äôd share it with you all. 

I found a brilliant post,that MUST be passed forward on how we ALL feel:Hope Underwood Note to my mother:

I am unconcerned that we have different politics. I do not think less of you because you voted one way and I voted another. We need people to vote and the candidate we select is not always going to win. It is hoped that we will have someone who is competent enough to run our country. That didn‚Äôt happen in the last election. We got a thin-skinned egomaniac who has never been held accountable for any atrocities he has committed. 

Let me be clear. I think less of you because you watched an adult mock a disabled man in front of a crowd and you still supported him. I think less of you because you saw a man spouting clear racism and you cheered for him. I think less of you because of your willingness to support someone who openly admires dictators and demonizes the press and anyone who criticizes him. I think less of you because you heard him advocate for war crimes and you still thought he should run this country. I think less of you because you watched him equate a woman‚Äôs worth to her appearance and you thought that was okay. I think less of you because you‚Äôve seen his appointees systematically destroy legal protections and loot the tax payers money and you are ok with that. You watched, along with the rest of the nation, as he separated families and locked innocent children in dog cages and you were not horrified as the rest of us were. You refuse to accept the fact that this man wants to work with dictators but has alienated our long standing allies. I think less of you because you refuse to review the facts and accept that this man is lying to you on a daily basis. It isn‚Äôt your politics I find repulsive. It is your willingness to support racism, sexism, misogyny, and cruelty that I find repulsive. You supported a tyrant and bully when it mattered and that is something I will never forgive or forget. Your lack of morals and basic humanity are devastating to me. 

There are some things I can never be civil about: concentration camps, genocide, white supremacy, misogyny, harm to children, mass trauma, state violence, rising fascism, to name a few. There is NO civil discussion with someone who agrees with putting children in dog cages. 

So, no...you and I will never be ‚Äúcoming together‚Äù to move forward or whatever. Trump literally disgusts me and I hate the sound of his voice spewing hate and diving the country but, the fact that he doesn‚Äôt disgust you is something that is going to stick with me long after this presidency. You have shown me who you really are and the fact that you still support this monster and rush to justify everything he does makes me feel that we have nothing to discuss."

I cannot believe that most of America is not recognizing WHAT it means to kneel on one knee with your helmet beside you when the national (American) anthem is playing with the national (American) flag flying high.  (Symbols of our democracy.)  The first thing I saw and thought was KNIGHT(s) IN SHINY ARMOR BEFORE THE QUEEN....making a plea for justice. I've never seen it any other way.  

And if every American remained seated during the playing of the anthem  it would not change a thing.
To view these giant men and their bravado as not supporting the flag and our union and our democracy is disheartening.  In fact, it is downright unAmerican to force any American to do  otherwise from what they want to do.  It is unAmerican.

Flashback: Nike Blasted by Bernie Sanders in 1997 for Outsourcing Jobs to Sweatshops in Vietnam
252

4 Sep 2018212
In 1997, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) blasted the Nike multinational corporation for outsourcing much of their workforce to alleged sweatshops in Vietnam.
During a speech on the Senate floor against the job-killing North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) free trade deal that was being pushed at the time, Sanders called out Nike for its documented history of outsourcing jobs to the lowest wage regions of the world to maximize profits and cut labor costs. Sanders asked:

The real wages for American workers are continuing to decline. Yes, the CEOs of major corporations saw a 54 percent increase in their compensation. Yes, the stock market is hitting off the wall. Yes, the rich are getting richer. But what about the average worker. Well the front pages of corporate America‚Äôs newspapers don‚Äôt talk about it. But for the average American worker, despite all the so-called boom, the real wages are going down. People continue to work long hours for low wages‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶

If our workers are forced to compete against desperate people in Mexico or in China who are trying to get by on starvation wages. If we merge these economies, what is the ultimate result?

Sanders began reading from a 1997 Associated Press report about workers in Vietnam at a Nike factory who rioted after the multinational corporation allegedly failed to pay them the $2.50 minimum wage.

Sanders said:

Nike has most recently swept national headlines as their latest ad campaign stars former NFL player and original anthem protester Colin Kaepernick. As Breitbart News has chronicled, sports fans have boycotted Nike for the ad, burning their Nike gear in response, and the multinational corporation has taken a hit in stock market shares.

577.0,,0,2018-09-09T14:39:45Z,"At first glance, yes. The problem with such a system in America is that the politicians are mostly lawyers. You go to countries that provide better connection to the citizenry and you see engineers and businessmen, doctors and high school teachers and so on. Lawyers aren‚Äôt businessmen in the classic sense of the word. To the average lawyer, paperwork is productivity‚Äîtalk is labor. When the average lawyer buys into a business that isn‚Äôt a law firm and takes a controlling interest in it, he stifles innovation and freedom.

This is true.

What the lawyer wastes everyone‚Äôs time doing is trying to protect that buisiness from other assholes like himself.

He makes people sign more paperwork he comes up with inane rules that now hinder actual productivity.

Congress functions no differently, but the forces they are hindering now involve the progress of the very concepts which provide allowances for the voices of the people to control the state.

Now, it is the interests of a small percentage who make their wealth through global finance and international corporate endeavors that has become the voice of the state.

Congress has gone along with it because the lion‚Äôs share of their access to cash comes from‚Äîwait for it....

It‚Äôs because the American people allow corporations to contribute unlimited campaign funds to political candidates.

Corporations shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to contribute anything at all.

Since when do corporate ideals represent the ideals of the people?

This is the primary issue that overwhelmingly exacerbates the problems inherent within the nationalistic corporation that the United States has mutated into.

THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

It‚Äôs capitalized...

That should have been your first clue.

Or do you think that it is the privilege of the employees of the police force to drag out reviewing evidence to allow one of there own to not be thrown in jail that very night and evidence reviewed immediately to lay charges? Now this story isn't so much about race as it is about POLICE PRIVILEGE but that is at the core of the treatment that cops have with minorities in general and blacks in particular.

You don't have to do it but if you don't then you shouldn't criticise other people for not letting you play the sport that you were garbage at anyways anymore. The problem for me isn't that he didn't stand up for the anthem but that he is being promoted and making millions from showing disrespect to his nation. And its not ok to popularise such things especially in Colin's case given that he is completely uninformed and a supporter of communism and dictatorships...

""(Robert E. Lee) even supported getting rid of the Confederate flag after the Civil War ended. He didn't want it flying above Washington College, of which he was president after the war.""

""Lee did not want such divisive symbols following him to the grave,"" Horn wrote. ""At his funeral in 1870, flags were notably absent from the procession. Former Confederate soldiers marching did not don their old military uniforms, and neither did the body they buried.""

""According to (Robert E. Lee's biographer, Jonathan) Horn, Lee's daughter wrote, ""His Confederate uniform would have been 'treason' perhaps!""

""Lee believed countries that erased visible signs of civil war recovered from conflicts quicker,"" Horn told PBS. ""He was worried that by keeping these symbols alive, it would keep the divisions alive.""

Robert E. Lee opposed erecting any statues honoring himself or anyone else associated with the CSA.

""... the number of Confederate memorial installations peaked around 1910 ‚Äî 50 years after the end of the Civil War and at the height of Jim Crow, an era defined by segregation and disenfranchisement laws against black Americans. Confederate installations spiked again in the 1950s and 1960s, during the Civil Rights Movement.""

Robert E. Lee was a brave, loyal, and wise individual.  So wise that he realized the Country couldn't heal so long as there were permanent reminders of that tragic conflict.  Which is why he opposed them, even to his death and burial.  The Civil War was/is a part of our history as a Nation.  It needs to be studied in books, but not celebrated with statues and monuments."

The owners have the authority to limit free speech.

But, that's not the issue. Professional black athletes have been using their position to make political statements for decades. Colin isn't exactly a trailblazer. The NFL can change their policies and penalize kneeling as they see fit, but the government can't force the NFL to change their policy. 

I just find it frustrating that the reason for kneeling is lost in this conversation, and Trump is changing the narrative either because he doesn't get it or he doesn't care. Trump is changing the narrative to something else that will win over his base, and paint kneeling as an attack on our military and veterans....while at the same time, he is being disrespectful to the McCain family.

I very much agreed with Trump WHEN he agreed with Nikki Haley about retiring the Confederate flag to museums. Unfortunately, he flipped on the issue in 2016 due to a large number of Reps who were upset about giving in to PC.  

You have to understand that the issue is so complicated that almost nobody seems to really understand the different feelings of the different groups who still want to display the Confederate flag ‚Äì or at least not eradicate it, aside from a large number who actually are either racist or prejudiced. 

Still, I feel strongly that it should be a very rare case in which the Confederate flag is displayed and only then if those who support that can explain to the rest of us why it is important, because I just don‚Äôt get it. 

Bottom line though, not everyone who cares about the Confederate flag is racist."

I am 100% with you on Trump's disrespect to a Gold Star family, ‚Äúinsulting our NATO allies, and behaving like a petulant brat and refusing to apologize for saying a POW isn't a war hero.... ‚Äú

However, I do not think it is fair to unduly criticize Trump for not ‚Äúrefusing to release a WH statement about his death and thanking him for his sacrifice, and raising the WH flag to full staff in defiance‚Äù WITHOUT at least acknowledging Sen McCain‚Äôs uncharacteristic pettiness at requesting Trump not attend his funeral.  That was a very clear, very public and very serious slap in the face.  

Obviously, Trump partially deserved it by inviting those ill-feelings with his petulant behavior.  Still, disinviting a sitting president from attending a funeral in which ill-feelings could have been buried and forgiveness given was very unstatesman-like.

Just FYI, while Trump did not give a proclamation to KEEP the flag at half-staff past the normal, traditional period, the flag was in fact lowered to half-staff again on the same day it was raised due to criticism.  

Trump should also have forgiven McCain and buried his ill-feelings by acting appropriately, even if McCain did not.  Trump will regret being so small in the future (we hope). Of course, McCain already regrets his lack of forgiveness (assuming he really did make the request and not his family) since it was contrary to the commandments of our father."

While the GOVERNMENT cannot force you to participate in patriotic rituals, neither can it force you to NOT willingly give up any right that you have.  If it were so, then the fundamental underpinning of our Constitution would cease to exist.

It's place should be in museum just like any natzi flag. But I am not here to talk about that.  Let me tell you my story. I am US citizen born in Poland. I won green card lottery. I went thru extreme vetting process and checks to be approved to get it. Thru the entire process I was never guaranteed to get it. I came to USA, worked, graduated from university here. I live in Chicago.  City full of legal and illegal immigrants. We are not criminals we just want to work and be left alone. This is proven by scientific research showing immigrants commit less crimes. I had some rough times and was on unemployment for a while. Trump sees me as an potential criminal, terrorist and the worst person. he said every country gives USA their worst people. And that we suck the system out of resources. His administration plans to ban green cards holders from getting citizenship if they use some public aid. They do not really define what they mean by public aid. So I am glad I already have citizenship because if they pass this law I probably wouldn't be able to get citizenship anymore, but I wouldn't be surprised if the law will be retroactive. Most terrorists attacks are done by native born US citizens again something backed up by research. Trump sees immigrants from middle East as potential terrorists and bans them. If I see Trump supporter I assume they backing his  populist policies that are not proven by any scientific research but Trump doesn't care. So this is why I see his supporters as racist... because he builds his support on blaming minorites and I am sorry but if someone still supports him after all his populist talk and sexism they are part of the problem.

turns out ""Kaepernick's"" name and race is German white, mixed with black, privileged to be raised and schooled by caring adoptive American white people after his African dad decided Colin's black life didn't matter and left him while he was a fetus and his mama put him up for adoption in the USA.. 

Maybe he kneels for black lives cause he wants his daddy to love him? Maybe he's lookin' for his daddy? Maybe his grandparents or great-grandparents were Nazis who killed Americans? Maybe that's why he kneels on the USA flag and hates America? What's he trying to do? Install his own government and overthrow USA's current government ala Hitler style?

KKKolin KKKaepernick (German¬†surname¬†K√§pernick derived from K√∂ppernig) is the true definition of white privilege indeed.

I'm kneeling on Colin's underserved white privileges and his misguided BLM daddy movement for all the REAL Americans and others who'll join.."

You said, "" And your point on his ""Qualifications to be president"" I did not miss, it was irrelevant seeing as though there is no proof that he did it for self service, it was just your opinion.""

Again, I think you still missed the points.

1. I have had a ""bone spur"" on my heel, technically called ""plantar fasciitis"".  The pain is tremendous!  Pain like that you don't forget!  For that reason, I don't think he had any bone spurs. (opinion)

2. IF I had had bone spurs, and IF I had a doctor write me a letter excusing me from the Draft, especially in the mid-1960s, I would remember who he was because I would have been so grateful! (opinion)

3. In the mid-60s, during the Viet Nam War, Draft eligible men were NOT excused from the Draft because the man's personal physician wrote a ""strongly worded"" letter.  They had to be examined by a Selective Service physician. (fact)

I have a close relative who had a bad knee, the result of a football injury.  He had x-rays and his medical record that clearly showed that he wasn't a fit candidate for Military Service, but he still had to go for the pre-induction physical.  It was only after being examined by their physician did the Selective Service classify him 1Y, which was ironic, since he WANTED to enlist. (fact)

THAT's why DT's claim that a ""strongly worded letter"" got him excused doesn't pass the smell test. (opinion, based on fact)

4. His disdain for and outrageously insulting comments about John McCain and his Service and sacrifice to this Country are inexcusable!  I get it that they were said during a hotly contested campaign.  So what!  There is no excuse for those remarks.  Especially from a man who would be our CIC. (fact)

5. His disdain for and outrageously insulting remarks as they applied to all Viet Nam War POWs. (fact)

6. His disdain for and outrageously insulting and/or insensitive remarks about/to Gold Star Mothers. (facts)

These are not the only reasons why I have a low opinion of DT.  But they'll do, for me.  Don't misunderstand me!  If I were still Serving in uniform, I would salute and render to him all the respect due to the President of the United States and my Commander in Chief.  But I would still have very little respect for the man.  He's done and said enough to waste all of those chips as far as I'm concerned."
,246.0,0,2018-09-19T00:10:26Z,"The man has literally talked to more doctors and people and businessmen etc. then most people have being a businessmen himself. It has also been 40 odd years since that happened and I highly doubt he has that well of a memory, the human brain is programmed to remember what is important in the moment not from the past as it is over and will not matter anymore ( Why do you think businessmen have secretary's ). And your point on his ""Qualifications to be president"" I did not miss, it was irrelevant seeing as though there is no proof that he did it for self service, it was just your opinion."
,247.0,0,2018-09-18T23:52:24Z,"BeastBen_2004,

Some friends and I were talking not long ago, and the question was asked, ""What is the first thing you'd do if you were elected President?""

All agreed, the best answer was, ""Resign!""  No one present wanted that job.  We decided it is a 'Catch 22' job: If you want it, that clearly indicates you shouldn't have it, because only a crazy person would want it.

Apparently you missed the point I was making with my paen against Pres. Trump being qualified to be our Commander in Chief.  When it mattered, he put service to self against service to Country.

The Records of his local Draft Board duly records his history of 2S Student deferments for the four years he was in college, the change to 1A when he graduated, and the change to 1Y/4F, Unqualified to Serve shortly thereafter.  What is missing is any documentation to support the change to 1Y/4F.  Documentation the Selective Service required.

Add to that his statement that he couldn't remember the name of the doctor who wrote the ""strongly worded letter"" and the fact that neither the letter nor the doctor's name is in his records, and the story begins to, candidly, stink.  Speaking for myself, and probably at least half of those who served in that War, if I had a doctor who wrote a ""strongly worded letter"" excusing me from the Draft, you better believe I'd remember his name!

Addendum, approx. 5 minutes after posting the above:

Therefore, my conclusion is that somebody at his local Draft Board ""pencil Whipped"" in his 1Y/4F classification as a personal favor to him and/or his dad.  In short, he dodged the Draft, and honorable service to his Country."

But there are SO MANY different ways that is here today to get an opinion to people that he could have chosen a way that would not stir controversy, he has a social media, he could if he tried get a spot on a news channel even if it was just local but that's the thing.

,249.0,0,2018-09-18T22:59:36Z,"BeastBen_2004

I'm old enough to remember MLK being assassinated in 1968, 50 years ago.  Back then, nobody knows just how many black people were murdered by officers who were sworn to protect and serve because nobody cared enough about it to keep track.

But because an uppity black man by the name of Martin Luther King Jr. decided to peacefully protest, ""white America"", myself included, started to take notice.  There must have been HUNDREDS of ways for his people to make the point without trespassing onto lunch counters and holding ""illegal"" marches across bridges and such, but would anyone have noticed?  I doubt it.  I know I didn't notice until he did.

You say, ""CK disrespected the Country and those who gave their lives fighting for our freedom."" As one of those who gave four years of my life, and my health for the rest of my life, in service to my Country, I fully support CK's right to protest AND the issue he is protesting.  If it upsets some people, they probably need to be made to feel uncomfortable.

He did not disrespect MY Country, MY Flag, or MY sensibilities.  The fact that people think it's more important to not disturb the ""opening ceremonies"" of a professional football game by peacefully making a statement about police brutality/murder indicates that, like MLK's peaceful, though illegal protests and marches of the 1960s, it's a statement that still needs to be made"

,254.0,0,2018-09-14T08:00:35Z,"Kneeling during the Anthem hasn't hurt anybody. Donald Trump, after he graduated from the Wharton School of Business in 1968, lost his 2S Student Draft Deferment and was re-classified 1A.  In less than three months, that classification was changed to 1Y, then 4F, unfit for military service.  Because he had ""bone spurs"" on his heels.  Couldn't march or carry a gun or any of that military stuff.

Young Donald Trump was an award winning athlete who excelled at all the sports he competed in: track, football, baseball, and la crosse.  When he was asked about the heel spurs during the Presidential campaign, he couldn't remember which foot they were on.  Or maybe they were on both feet.  He couldn't remember.  He did remember that a doctor wrote a letter for him, (""A very strongly worded letter!""), excusing him from his Military obligation.  But he couldn't remember the doctor's name.

Because he was excused from the Draft, someone else had to go in his place.  Possibly die in his place.  That's about as close as someone can come to spitting on a Veteran's grave without actually doing it.  Nobody has,or will, die because CK took a knee.  CK, on one knee, stands taller and braver than DT ever has."

By your logic if I moved to Australia and accused my new country of being evil for engaging in a systematic practice of murdering children born with blue eyes, which I said was ingrained in their entire country, from its founding to its leadership to everyday discrimination against blue eyed people, and then I organized a movement to chant and picket every time they sang their anthem and hung little signs under their flags everywhere I saw them that read ""australia should be ashamed of systematically murdering blue eyed babies,"" I would be called an unpatriotic Australian who clearly thinks the country is fundamentally flawed and a delusional idiot on top of that. But YOU would run up to them and say ""no, no, you guys don't get it. his behavior of shaming your flag and anthem and accusing your country of being fundamentally evil in some way is not only NOT unpatriotic, but it's PATRIOTIC. He's just trying to IMPROVE Australia with his movement and make you all stop being blue-eyed baby murderers."" Do you see how ridiculous you sound yet? I'm sure not...

You worship your flag and your country in some incestuous union where the zealous fervour of rabid nationalism and the zealous fervour of religion find a happy medium and are consummated.  This isn't normal. No other countries (including the 3rd-world) force their kids to ""pledge allegiance"" to ideals they don't even understand. In the _actual_ free world (developed nations outside the usa), we don't force our kids to pledge allegiance to anything!

,283.0,0,2018-09-09T05:29:11Z,"Kaepernick was an NFL quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers. Two years ago he was fired and banned¬†from the NFL for kneeling during the National Anthem. However, he wasn't kneeling against the National Anthem. His true purpose of kneeling was to protest against the police brutality against black people in America. After Kaepernick was fired this inspired other people in the NFL to take a kneel as well. This made the NFL¬†organization angry¬†and they decided to fire any body that took a kneel during the National Anthem. Donald Trump sent out tweets against the NFL protesters that were taking kneels during the National Anthem and made negative remarks about those who did it. The so called ""Patriots"" of America claimed that they were never going to watch an NFL game again as long as the football players kept kneeling.¬†Fortunately NFL ratings actually dropped but not by a large or scary margin. Donald Trump was winning. Months later¬†Nike decided to be in a commercial with Kaepernick. This commercial however would show Kaepernick talking about doing what you believe in is right even if it means risking everything which was referring to when he got banned from the NFL for kneeling. This commercial would be shown during¬†the NFL halftime commercials and many people were debating over this. Donald Trump decided to send out more tweets but this time about Nike. Trump supporters and Trump himself thought they would win once again and make Nike lose money like they did the NFL. Luckily, this didn't work one bit and Nike's stock just boosted up 31%. Now the racists of America and Trump himself are fighting a losing battle. Nike is a multi national billion dollar company who's prices just sky rocketed because of the commercial they aired on TV with Kaepernick himself. Now there are many people in America getting triggered that they didn't get their ways."

RE: ‚ÄúEVERYTHING) BLACK AMERICANS HAVE DONE TO FURTHER THIS NATION‚Ä¶ WE‚ÄôRE VIEWED AS ‚ÄúUNPATRIOTIC‚Äù AT THE TIME However, time has vindicated their decision in every instance.‚Äù

In most instances, yes. Especially when acting collectively. 

In every instance? Hardly. 

You will have to explain how disrespecting the anthem/flag furthers this nation.  If this was Josh Gibson (Washington Grays, Negro Leagues) or even Jim Brown (RB, Cleveland Browns) in his early days, then I and most people today would wholly agree because the government and people living under the flag at that time did not consider them equal as either sportsmen or even citizens. Therefore, kneeling at a game in protest of not having equal rights as a sportsman is certainly appropriate behavior even if some may not agree that it is the best way. 

Comes now Kaepernick in 2016 and kneels in protest of primarily (if not only) black people who are mistreated, wronged, hurt and even murdered by violent citizens and even cops who are black and white and everything in between, in many towns and cities. .  Kaepernick seems to think that it only happens to black people and then only by people who are not black.

This is not condoned nor allowed to happen by the Constitution, the federal government nor the American people ‚Äì all whom the anthem and flag represent.  It is only condoned by bad individuals and a minority of cities and towns in the U.S. and it happens in substantial numbers, though less proportionally, to all races  

Therefore, to protest the anthem and flag is to accuse or strongly imply that the American people and government as a whole of allowing this to happen, or are not doing enough to prevent it.  That is utterly and flatly false.  For this reason, Kaepernick deserves the disrespect of all Americans.  He chose the wrong means to his end. 

If anyone misunderstands what it means to be part of the armed forces in which you protect and defend the Constitution, which the flag represents, which guarantees freedom and equal rights to all people, regardless of their background, race or whatever, it is you.  

All people of all races are equal and should be treated that way.  Kaepernick does not understand that yet. If you do not understand that either, then perhaps you are just as ignorant.  Hopefully, you will find the necessary courage to face that truth and change."

It was definitely a peaceful protest. No one has a problem with that.  

The real problem is that he disrespected the whole nation by wrongfully using the anthem/flag to protest something that was not related to the flag.  

More acutely, he disrespected all non-black people by expressing concern for only black people who experience suffering and pain from being wronged, but showed no concern for all the non-black people represented by the flag and in direct contradiction of what the flag truly stands for; the equal freedoms of everyone.  

So, no I do not like the poor reason for his peaceful protest, and the reason is expressly because I do like freedom. 

It is those who think that people of other colors or races are not equal or do not count who belong in North Korea.

Just because he has the same rights we all do does not mean we have to agree with him.  Believe it or not, we also have the same rights of free speech too and so we can also express our opinions.

Those who paid to see sports games and programs have a right to expect those games and programs to be free of political opinions and personal issues ‚Äì unless the issue or problem emanates from the sport itself, which was not the case. 

Blaming the federal government and the people as a whole, as represented by the flag and anthem, is simply false and unjust.  The deaths by police are not a result of a failure of our Constitution, the federal government, or the people in general. It is due to a minority of corrupt individuals, cities and towns.

Further, it is also racist because Kaepernick is only concerned about black people - as if only black people are unjustly shot or murdered by police; or as if only NON-black police unjustly kill or murder blacks.  

For all these reasons, we should not ignore such open, wrongful behavior but rather we have a duty to speak out and condemn it.

Mr Kaepernick likely means well, but his ignorance is deplorable and offensive."

,331.0,0,2018-09-10T07:03:49Z,"ROBERT: If you intentionally fail to give due respect to the symbol of freedom and our Constitution, the cause should be justly related to a failure of either the Constitution, the government or the people represented by that flag and not by a cause in which only some people or some state or local governments are guilty of, and certainly not by politicizing the NFL or one‚Äôs employer.

For this reason, most people do not respect Kaepernicks misguided attempt publicize his causes, however well-meaning he may  be.  This is more particularly true since Kaepernick's concerns only seem to be for those who are black who experience pain and suffering from being wronged.  Apparently, the pain and suffering of those who are NOT black who have been wronged do not count.  That is classic racism.  

If you are honest and true to your oath to defend the Constitution, you would neither condone kneeling in support of a fundamentally racist concern nor in support of any cause which falsely blames the government and people for acting contrary to the Constitution when they have not done so."

1020.0,,0,2018-09-09T01:42:17Z,"Remember in the '80 when Reagan promoted the continued investment in apartheid South African krugerrand to help stabilize the racist abuse of all but people who are European or of European descent. Basically apartheid was a caste system that used everyone that was not white as some form of labor. And marriage out side racial delineations were illegal; with long prison sentences. Being that 90% of South African were not white of some sort. Students boycotted going Jr. highschool and Highschool protested by leaving school for months. The reason for this was that those schools purpose was to train menial labor.

Those  protests that student were involved with often ended with Africans being shot, tear gassed, beaten, raped water cannons turned on them, as well people being tortured by various means including being sodomized  hooked up to industrial batteries and having currents past through their bowels & genitalia; & what was left ended up in an unmarked hole. 

So, back in the '80's there were boycotts of companies invested in businesses in   South Africa and doing business in South Africa. Many national universities in the United States & international corporations divested all of their investment positions & all their investment vehicles such as pensions, hedge funds & direct stocks of companies in Apartheid South Africa & Southern Africa such as Coke, Xerox, Nike, & people having headlining gigs at Sun City casinos & vacation events in South Africa. There is a video about the efforts to boycott international artist playing in Sun City called united artist against Sun City. Picture a boycott of artist playing in Las Vegas to get the scale of what the gigs were about. Kind of like U2 boycott of states that not honoring the Martin Luther King Jr holiday.  

So, Reagan's promoting the continued investment in krugerrands &  support of Apartheid South African continued existence because  Black South Africans were not ready to govern themselves & the certainty that the blacks would be dups of Communist USSR agendas as well as the fact that no country on the continent other than Israel and Apartheid South Africa could be tolerated to have such armaments. Israel never signed the nuclear non proliferation agreement. But it is widely known that before Apartheid South Africa came apart it and Israel worked together to secure nuclear armaments for themselves. Both countries were of the belief that their enemies were clawing at their sanctuary & only the knowledge of certain death could keep those enemies at bay. 

Well, Nelson Mandela's statesmanship held off the certain ruin of all. He was the leader who signed the nuclear non proliferate treaty. Israel has not signed. But much like India and Pakistan's stalemate they flouted the world until they had nuclear weapons & then came back to the world at large. 

Part of their situation is that they might use them & if Isis, the Taliban or Al-Qaeda got a hold of Pakistan nuclear weapons they might launch on India, Israel, the Saudi's or here in America. I mean who believes that if Assad in Syria had or could get such technology that he would not use it?

Anyway, social protests are far better than some of the other forms that could be taking place.

If this summer has been hot, who's looking forward to the fall? 

Halloween is only a few days away from election day. Make sure your vote make your voice count. 

Thanks Colin Kaepernick, thank you LeBron James, thank you John McCain, thank you John Brennan & thank you Bob Woodward... & thank you to all the nameless, faceless individuals keeping this country from running off the tracks. 

We are citizen of the world & where there is despair anywhere there despair everywhere. None of us can extricate ourselves from the horror & hopelessness of the human condition; especially not from the plight of humanity measured by ROI, as opposed to educating & giving  the tools needed to open up human potential and opening up the horizons of the young.

I don't know about how they do it in the US, but my local charity shops sanitize shoes and, if the items are worth it, will launder any items that aren't up to scratch before putting them out for sale. I don't know about Nike shoes as I've never owned a pair, but most of the runners I've owned are washable and I also sanitize my shoes regularly to avoid nasties.

Also, a lot of Republicans liked him, and I believe the investigation into his deeds lasted over 5 years.

I WILL say this, if Obama was any more ""Liberal"" Republicans would have had his head. Remember how harshly EVERY LITTLE THING was criticized. He stepped outside the norms by wearing a tan suit. UNACCEPTABLE. Now look at 45's behavior, excused & justified constantly."
,510.0,0,2018-09-09T20:16:27Z,"justin holmes, first off, Obama is the first President SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION to not achieve 3%. He achieved 2.96%. The rest of the world, including China, averaged out at 1.9% during the Recession. He could have probably achieved around 3.2% if he went with austerity measures, but as a working class Americans in the middle class, I‚Äôm glad he didn‚Äôt. Only a conservative would hate a President for having a heart. 
.3% increase in GDP, in my opinion, wasn‚Äôt worth the pain to the average citizen. Might have pissed off a few corporations and ‚Äúfuck everyone else‚Äù Republicans. 

 Some of that nine trillion in debt you want to whine about kept MANUFACTURING jobs in the US when we needed them most. The lion‚Äôs share of it was to bail out the lenders that caused the Recession in the first place! Thanks to some key deregulation done under Bush (Clinton did some deregulation, but Bush did the ones that companies used to ruin the economy), and the corruption that was increased under Bush in both Parties, Obama had little choice but to bail them out. They DID fund his campaign, after all. Another good part of that money was needed to fund the Bush tax cuts and make them permanent. He wouldn‚Äôt have done that either, but he was trying to compromise with House Republicans and THEY wanted that. In the end, they lied to Obama. He didn‚Äôt make the same mistake when he enacted Romneycare. It‚Äôs more than fair to say that the waste of money was a problem not of Obama‚Äôs making, but he had to act right into office. He did ok. 
 
You will have to explain to me how he divided the country by race. I say that was done by the Republicans in both the House and the Senate. Obama won both of his elections with a majority vote. Something only one Republican could manage in the past 30 years, and he was an incumbent that started an illegal war. He won by the margins he did PRECISELY because he was CONSTANTLY trying to bring the nation together, while Republicans were disrespecting him for OBVIOUSLY racial reasons. Many of them believed he wasn‚Äôt even American, until he put out his long form birth certificate. Even then, some insisted that it was a fake. An ALL REPUBLICAN committee was put together just to investigate it. They didn‚Äôt relent until the FBI verified his birth. Eight years later, a group of mostly white voters would vote into office the guy who NEVER accepted that Obama was an American. 

I think your blaming Obama for dividing the country by race, based on the facts, is misplaced. At every turn, the guy tried to compromise with Republicans. Despite being popularly elected TWICE, Republicans took every opportunity to obstruct his agenda, even when he agreed with Republicans. In a final insult, they blocked a pick for SCOTUS that was legally and rightfully his to make. They couldn‚Äôt even claim he wanted an ultra liberal judge. Quite the opposite, actually. They wouldn‚Äôt give his pick a vote because they hated him for being Black. Half-Black in truth, but that was still too much. 

Policy-wise, these were moderate Republican moves. I still think of Obama as a moderate Republican, because his policies could have be much more liberal than they were.

I have many reason to hate Drumpf. Chief among them is because he is a pussy. The proof is overwhelming. Second, because he is a pathological liar. Both of these are enough, but I could rattle off at least five other reasons to hate this man. All of them truth. All of them well evidenced."

These protests have become politicized.  To deny that is to deny reality.  CK and many other NFL players have taken their stances, and the NFL has taken theirs.  The lines are drawn, so to speak.

CK has not been a relevant athlete since his half-season with the Cardinals where he lost the Super Bowl.  He is a bottom tier QB.  If it wasn't for his protesting, he would have gone the way of Tim Teebow and RG3: being all but forgotten.  Why is Nike making the face of an irrelevant athlete into their spokesman?

1241.0,,0,2018-09-09T00:00:48Z,"SUKABUMI, Indonesia --Workers making Converse sneakers in
Indonesia say supervisors throw shoes at them, slap them in the face and call
them dogs and pigs. Nike, the brand's owner, admits that such abuse has occurred among
the contractors that make its hip high-tops but says there was little it could
do to stop it.That does not appear to explain abuses
that workers allege at the Pou Chen Group factory in Sukabumi, some 60 miles
from Jakarta. It didn't start making Converse products until four years after
Nike bought Converse. One worker there said she was kicked by a supervisor last
year after making a mistake while cutting rubber for soles. 



""We're powerless,"" said the woman, who like several others
interviewed spoke on condition of anonymity out of fear of reprisals. ""Our
only choice is to stay and suffer, or speak out and be fired."" 

The 10,000 mostly female workers at the Taiwanese-operated Pou Chen plant make
around 50 cents an hour. That's enough, for food and bunkhouse-type lodging,
but little else. Some workers interviewed by the AP in March and April
described being hit or scratched in the arm -- one man until he bled. Others
said they were fired after filing complaints. 

""They throw shoes and other things at us"" said a 23-year-old woman in
the embroidery division. ""They growl and slap us when they get angry. 

""It's part of our daily bread."" 

Mira Agustina, 30, said she was fired in 2009 for taking sick leave, even
though she produced a doctor's note. 

""It was a horrible job,"" she said. ""Our bosses pointed their
feet at us, calling us names like dog, pig or monkey."" All are major insults
to Muslims. Indonesia is the world's most populous Muslim nation. 

At the PT Amara Footwear factory located just outside Jakarta, where another
Taiwanese contractor makes Converse shoes, a supervisor ordered six female
workers to stand in the blazing sun after they failed to meet their target of
completing 60 dozen pairs of shoes on time. 

""They were crying and allowed to continue their job only after two hours
under the sun,"" said Ujang Suhendi, 47, a worker at a warehouse in the
factory. The women's supervisor received a warning letter for the May incident
after complaints from unionized workers. 

The company's own inquiries also found workers at the two factories were
subjected to ""serious and egregious"" physical and verbal abuse,
including the punishment of forcing workers to stand in the sun, said Hannah
Jones, a Nike executive who oversees the company's efforts to improve working
conditions."

1251.0,,0,2018-09-08T23:57:38Z,"Watching this from England on a night when England lost to Spain in football. We talked about Harry Kane's  new Nike boots but when I mentioned Kapernick, no one had even heard of him. Only after explaining the situation with his new position in Nike's new ads and the ""Take a knee"" campaign there was a vague recognition, mostly because Donald  Trump has ranted incoherently against it. When commentators claim that Nike is playing to a global audience or market, I can't see how this has any credibility, as the NFL  has very limited global reach and Colin Kapernick is  more known in political debate than in sports. I hope this changes but even with NFL games games being played at Wembley stadium (which I can see from my home). The only people in London with the slightest interest in the NFL are the transient gypsy like American bankers that live in London one week and Manhattan the next, and are attending games that are mostly paid from some corporate account. If you were to stand outside Wembley stadium on an NFL game day you would have to pay any local to attend a game, especially if there is any decent footy game on the telly. 
 My point is. If it's true as the commentators say, this is about a global market play by Nike. Then it's a 90 yard hail Mary pass to  a wide receiver who's so wide he's still in the locker room, taking a knee and reading the first chapter of Football for Dummies (not the soccer edition)."

1258.0,,0,2018-09-08T23:53:44Z,The problem with Kaepernick is that he hasn't identified a specific goal where which we can basically be working toward. For example if he said he is going to take a knee until such and such person is voted out of office. Or he's going to take a knee until a white police officer who illegally shoots a person of color is convicted of murder which happened a couple of weeks ago in Texas. Or he's going to take a knee until at least one year passes where no person of color is shot illegally by white officer. Give some goal that can be achieved. To say take a knee as long as there are injustices is just too broad for people to work toward achieving a goal.

NIKE IS NOT ONLY A BLACK COMPANY, BUT THEY HAVE GIVEN JORDAN AND LEBRON LIFETIME BILLION DOLLAR DEALS.

There's a number of customs that don't greet people by shaking hands either. You don't determine for everyone what to do to show respect but taking a knee is a universal way of showing respect. The players chose to take a knee for that very reason. If they instead raised their fists, then I'd agree that it's disrespectful. By the way, I'm not liberal. I'm just a conservative that has a soul and a conscience."
,667.0,0,2018-09-09T00:51:33Z,Refusing to stand for the anthem is of course a sign of disrespect toward the flag/anthem/country. It's astonishing how much difficulty liberals have with this.

1575.0,,0,2018-09-08T22:09:53Z,"Nike thought about this very smart and here's why they did what they did.

1. Kaepernick will be remembered as the Ali of this time period so history will look good on him. Nike wanted to say she always knew.

2. Majority of Nike's customers were always black people in America. So basically Nike didn't give a fuck in Conservative whites burn their product. It does make Nike like they back their customers while those against them look racist even if they aren't.

3. Kaepernick signed to them since 2011.  In their mind why not keep supporting him. Hell, they have been paying him since 2011. 

4. Their stock went down so they just brought back more of their company. Nike knew exactly what they were doing and they knew what it would look like.

5. Nike's Ceo never liked Trump even before Trump became president. That's been around for years

So in the hindsight of things, Nike was playing Chess every move they made was thought out and planned while Trump supporters were playing tic tac toe. 

Also thanks Trump supporters for backing Trump I just brought a bunch of Nike stock myself."

Youtube kids killed over shoes, it's shocking that the message Nike pushes, the status they say the shoes will give you, is so sought after that people will kill for them
So my question is, If Kaepernick cared about black people, why would he take money from this company? How about he takes all that Nike money and donates it to revitalizing a ghetto. Not fucking bloody likely."
1588.0,,1,2018-09-08T22:07:08Z,"üòí Nope...don't say ""most"" Americans. This American and many in my circle of friends do not agree with it. In addition, when they're on the field they're working they're being paid to do a job. When you're not on the clock and you're not getting paid you can run through the streets and do whatever you want to do in protest...not while you're working. No company allows anyone to do that. Not even you CNN.

America is a great nation with some issues, but I think it's unfortunate when people disrespect it. If you don't like it here there's so many other places around the world you can move to. I guarantee you'll be back because there's none like this one, no freedoms, no other fair system of justice, no economy, no other religious freedoms like America!
Basically, if it's so bad why do so many people want to come here?

After, the South African government said it was false and not a crisis. No. 45 hasn't said angthing back so crisis or not? He makes a big deal about standing for a flag but has repeatedly disrespected non whites who serve our country which makes him racist.  There has been more school shootings under his administration by maga teens than ever before. His leadership has whites all across the country calling the cops on everything to no avail! HE INITIALLY LIED ABOUT STORMY DANIELS AND ABOUT MEETING PUTIN BEFORE!!!! I don't have multiple lives to explain all the number crunching from his inauguration attendance to Puerto Rico hurricane death toll b.s. statements from him. He can't even pronounce anonymous on cue! That shows how unprepared he is and how he just wings it all the time and that's dangerous. You're right about one thing, he has divided this country more than the past four and you dont think the tax cuts for the rich isnt going to lead to another recession? Thats why he cant take credit for the economy. The effects arent ever noticable in a year's time. That's why a recession won't show just yet either. HE STILL RUNS HIS BUSINESSES THROUGH HIS FAMILY AND CUT CHECKS,  BUT WITH WHO MONEY THIS TIME? He is corrupt and why does he need to appoint judges if there was no collusion? Im done here and i cant keep going back and forth with someone who says he done more but doesn't name anything on his own. At least i came with my points.

,929.0,0,2018-09-08T23:48:56Z,alans73 sorry but I'm not lying. Also I don't support everything Trump does nor all of his policies. I do support some of the stuff Trump has done. I support some od what Obama has done but not all of it. You don't have to be in a box where it is either all republican or all democrat. I don't approve of Trump making National Parks land area smaller for example. I am Native American Italian. Only one in my family like that. My italian family and french and Native family. The french part being a minor part and more of a to cover up the Native part back then. I have an Irish Native brother and sister. I have a mexican brother and a mexican italian sister. I have Indian siblings. Multiple of them and Black cousins. All of them I love. I like to brag about how my family is more diverse than most peoples friend list. Also living in black neighborhoods I have felt with racism. Wanted to date a mexican I wasn't allowed they didn't approve cause I was white. It bothers me so much because I actually cared about her and its not like I didn't know their culture. Every other weekend I would go see my mexican grandparents. They aren't blood but they are family. They taught their culture. We ate home made mexican food and every year they would take us all down to Mexico. The problem is I wasn't Mexican. I am left handed as well. Honestly I like being left handed because it is fun to make jokes and talk about it and its also fun when you meet another left handed person. Unless you are left handed you don't know the struggles. Green eyes that look blue sometimes and other times gray. I am also a male. Again Males are a minority. It is possible to support some of someone but not all of his policies or everything he does. It is possible to disagree with someone on almost everything but be working with someone on the issues that you do happen to agree on. That's the beauty of America.
,930.0,0,2018-09-08T22:26:18Z,"alans73 Not stupid. Also being a minority doesn't change anything because I am a minority for a lot of reasons.

All are minorities in America. There are more females than males.  Green eyes. Oh, I've also lived in black neighborhoods where I was the only white kid. I was a minority there and I didn't care. I've felt with racism. Not allowed to date this one girl because I'm not Mexican. Her parent don't approve. Even though I have Mexican siblings and grandparents and cousins. You seem to be the dumb one. Can't even make a single solid argument."

The NFL lost views and money from the kneeling people less people are watching the NFL now. They are also about to have competition with the XFL.

The way the NFL blackballed him from the NFL is not right at all only because he kneed before the US anthem starting an protest against police violence.

So, I'm puzzled if you despise ""the left"" so much why do you make comments on a video that promotes the beliefs of fairness & equality (aka justice) for all Americans?!

,1102.0,0,2018-09-14T08:11:37Z,"Simon Templar,

Kneeling during the Anthem hasn't hurt anybody. Donald Trump, after he graduated from the Wharton School of Business in 1968, lost his 2S Student Draft Deferment and was re-classified 1A.  In less than three months, that classification was changed to 1Y, then 4F, unfit for military service.  Because he had ""bone spurs"" on his heels.  Couldn't march or carry a gun or any of that military stuff.

Young Donald Trump was an award winning athlete who excelled at all the sports he competed in: track, football, baseball, and la crosse.  When he was asked about the heel spurs during the Presidential campaign, he couldn't remember which foot they were on.  Or maybe they were on both feet.  He couldn't remember.  He did remember that a doctor wrote a letter for him, (""A very strongly worded letter!""), excusing him from his Military obligation.  But he couldn't remember the doctor's name.

Because he was excused from the Draft, someone else had to go in his place.  Possibly die in his place.  That's about as close as someone can come to spitting on a Veteran's grave without actually doing it.  Nobody has,or will, die because CK took a knee.  CK, on one knee, stands taller and braver than DT ever has."
,1103.0,0,2018-09-13T16:32:47Z,It was a Green beret named Nate Boyer who convinced him to take a knee as a compromise to sitting. They do not do it to honor their fallen brethren. Nor do the marines.¬†No one is stopping his right to protest. But you try protesting something every time you go to work and do¬†it on the company dime and see ho long it will last. He can protest all he wants on his own time. If he really wants to make a profound statement take a knee in front of a police station¬†that was responsible for a black death. I'm sure there are plenty of media film crews out there that will follow him to get the message out.

,1112.0,0,2018-09-09T10:55:57Z,"Simon Templar police brutality against *black people in general* is what the kneeling is about. This isn‚Äôt a fantasy, it‚Äôs a very real fact that black people are harmed or killed disproportionately more by police than any other race. Botham Shem Jean is another example of this. An unarmed black man murdered in his own apartment because an officer mistook his apartment for her own. You mean to tell me that was justified? The fact that you‚Äôve labeled all of these kinds of murders as justified is exactly why we still protest. Because people like you keep on dismissing the lives of black people, presuming them guilty of something on very little basis to give justification for killing them. Then you have the nerve to tell me not to play the race card as if you‚Äôre not doing the exact same thing. Police brutality isn‚Äôt a false narrative, it is real and it‚Äôs a googable fact but since it doesn‚Äôt suit your narrative that they all deserved to die for no good reason, you don‚Äôt take the time to do research or even listen to people like me when we try to explain. I am black and my experiences are real and these countless examples are real and not a single one that has occurred in the last 6 years, since Trayvon, were justifiable murders. I am triggered and traumatized by these incidents every day of my life and when I see their families not receiving justice it is a reminder to me that my black ass life doesn‚Äôt matter to people like you. I can‚Äôt walk down the street, sit in a college dorm lobby and take a nap after studying, I can‚Äôt be pulled over without being assumed to have a weapon, I can‚Äôt even be in my own damn home because the color of my skin automatically makes me guilty of something before I‚Äôm presumed to be innocent of everything.

It had Nothing to do with race. But for some reason you decided to bring race into it by talking about who Nike built their brand on by endorsing black athletes. Everyone knows that but it has nothing to do with Kap and Nike situation. Thats why i said some people when they know 100% they are right, sometimes those people need to humble themselves and ignore the idiots talking shit. Which is exactly what Kap did and still is doing today. We both know that what Kap is doing is right. We know why hes doing it and we know he has every right to do what hes doing bc peacefully protesting is a right we all have. So when these idiots start talking shit about guys kneeling and they are disrespecting our military and they hate Trump so thats why they are doing it.

,1135.0,0,2018-09-09T03:32:22Z,"@Jared LW85 ok, if we're talking about Nike then let's do it. MJ had the first signature shoe ever by Nike and it was so successful that Nike began to invest in other pro athletes in all sports, but unfortunately the only sport that seemed to impact sales on a macro level was basketball, but more specifically the black basketball players. Nike tried endorsing white basketball players and white football players but the success was minimal. Nike saw what type of stars brought in the most returns, it was black basketball stars for some reason. So Nike gave Barkley, Pippen, Jordan, Kobe and others deals and all those endorsements were the most successful endorsement deals Nike ever had. EVEN AN IDIOT COULD FOLLOW THAT FORMULA. SO NIKE BUILT THERE EMPIRE MAINLY ON BASKETBALL SHOES FOR BLACK PLAYERS. THE BLACK ACTORS, RAPPERS AND YOUNG ADULTS WERE SPENDING MORE MONEY ON NIKES THAN ANY GROUP OF PEOPLE IN THE MAINSTREAM. SO NIKE STARTED CATERING TO THAT CULTURE AND ITS PAID MAJOR DIVIDENDS AND HASN'T SLOWED DOWN. PHIL NIGHT COULD BE A RACIST FOR ALL I KNOW, BUT THATS NOT THE POINT.

To anyone paying attention the dude is clearly an anti-american socialist while being more privileged than 99.99% of people in the country. He praises Castro and Malcom X while not standing for the US flag or anthem and donning socks depicting cops as pigs. He calls attention to an issue that‚Äôs not a real priority, and by that I mean it‚Äôs an significant issue facing the black community on a statistical basis, yet it gets you a lot of praise from people who operate off emotion over fact, and that‚Äôs the majority of people unfortunately. Imagine he made all this fuss over the epidemic of black on black crime? Our community engages in killing each other at alarming rates, more that any other racial group, a real issue that should be prioritized over the few unarmed black suspects shot by police each year, you have a better chance of being struck by lightning than being shot or injured by a cop...

So why such a Negative response to Colin Kaepernick about his positive message to young people all over the country that you are free your freedom has been bought and paid for enjoy your life and the Liberties that come with it. It is an injustice to America and the people of America to have the police shooting and killing unarmed people and making a false accusations about why it happened. It is an injustice to be American people to set up bait trucks to trap inner city property stricken young people. Kaepernick Colin Kaepernick is more of a man than any of these people that I have seen do anything for the young black boys and girls in America to say you are liberated staying up for your rights. Know your rights. Flavor flavor said stop the powers-that-be. Sit idly by why you slider our children in the streets. And you can keep your thoughts about it to yourself.

68.0,,0,2018-09-13T07:29:58Z,"I heard a high ranking priest did some really bad things. Then in church or any other place of worship (enter your religious place of worship here), a person decided to stand during prayer to protest what this high ranking priest did when everyone was respectfully kneeling before Christ. Don't disrespect Christ merely because there are bad actors within the religion. There is a time and a place for everything. Right message, wrong venue. Respect the flag, when the flag is honored. Don't disrespect something when it is time to honor it and then say the message is not about disrespect. So many are saying that this is not about disrespecting the flag, but when you protest during a ceremony that is respected by many people, you are not going to convince people this is not about disrespect. The very act of kneeling during the playing of the national anthem is disrespectful to the flag and what it stands for. The Flag stands for justice and equality even though there are those (rogue law enforcement) that do not follow what it stands for. Kapernick took a chance, and the chance landed him where he is now."

What about the dreams and ambitions of the people making your products Nike? Don't they matter as well? It sure would mean a lot more if you paid the producers a living wage they could use to pay for their ambitions and dreams - just like the dreams and ambitions of your consumers that you play on to sell your products. Go all the way Nike if you really want to make a real impact.

He is not stirring this fight because of patriotism.  He is a thin skinned loser and a racist.  He is getting white America to turn its back on black football players.  It has zero to do with the flag.  It was only a  few years ago that the Pentagon started paying the NFL to have players on the field when the anthem played to hopefully increase kids signing up for the military.  Before then the players were in the locker room when the anthem played.  When a fellow soldier is killed the men take a knee out of respect.  CK started taking a knee for brothers killed by police that was not being addressed.  It had nothing to do with the anthem or the flag.  Trump just wound people up.  Because of his NFL history and all you suckers fell for it.

I have been a fan of Football and the NFL since I could walk. The NFL should have made an example of him and the others from the start. Its a job not a right. The NFL should have fired them like any other employee. If we did what he did he'd have been fired.  I'm not blind to social injustice, and I think most of us are appalled by it. Standing for the Flag is about respect for those that have served or do serve. Its about those that have died to give them the freedom to protest. Everyone should have the right to protest and fight for what they believe in. Just don't use our Flag to do it. You aren't telling us anything we didn't already know. I hate to hang up my spurs but its time to stand for the flag and sit for Nike and the NFL."

If they did they would bring better working conditions where all their shoes are made in developing nations and they would be raising wages to those places to. People are so stupid.

486.0,,0,2018-09-06T13:10:06Z,"Although I agree with Kaepernick's message, I completely disagree with the method of delivering that message. Furthermore, I don't think he truly thought it through... instead of raising awareness about social injustice, his message became muddled and skewed, and  became a debate over patriotism and honoring our nation's flag and service members. And what has his protest accomplished, exactly? More people are arguing over the right to protest and showing respect for our flag as opposed to discussing the issues surrounding social injustice. Not to mention the fact that nothing has changed. Have any of the SJW's stepped up and taken any real action? If so, I haven't heard anything about it. But, I'm still hearing plenty about the debate over standing/kneeling for our nation's flag and anthem. 

I'm not entirely convinced Kaepernick's intentions are truly genuine and selfless either. I think he did this to cause controversy and make headlines for publicity. After all, they say there's no such thing as bad publicity. And now it's paid off in a nice lucrative deal with Nike. I'm wondering if he'll use any of the money he's making from this deal to help fight the social injustice he's supposedly so passionate about ü§î Do you think Nike truly cares? They saw an opportunity to create headlines and cash in on it. Like I said... no such thing as bad publicity. To those of you applauding Nike, this was strictly a strategic business decision on their part... nothing more and nothing less. 

It seems like the people that are cheering and applauding this Kaepernick/Nike deal are the same people who took to the streets and celebrated when O.J. was acquitted."

Football was a lot of peoples escape from real life issues. And America is divided enough and his stance caused more separation. Just wearing a team shirt could drum a positive conversation amongst strangers and after him taking a kneel and the media made a big deal out of people. Now wearing a team shirt can cause pure hate on both sides. Trust everything is scripted... Take it how you like it.

556.0,,51,2018-09-05T23:59:48Z,"Ok people, lets look at this once again. Colin Kapernick took a knee because of injustices, he sat down at first then a military veteran told him to take a knee and he did with no argument. It was a peaceful protest because of what the flag is supposed to stand for which it has never done since it's existence especially when race is involved and if you don't believe that then look how people are reacting. Our military  is not really ours, it's the government's. Therefore the government controls the military not the people. The respect comes from the people more than the government so what does that tell you especially when Kapernick respectively considered the veterans suggestion. I guess people are ok with injustices of course only when it doesn't happen to them. Honestly everyone who believes in our country, believes in the flag should be supportive to Kapernick but unfortunately they do not and it shows what people really want or think about this country, our rights, the constitution, bill of rights. Obviously none of that matters and they are going against everything this country is supposed to stand for, that seems very stupid and this is not an opinion it is a fact.

You make a choice that is right to u u cant force others to do wat u want in just getting this out there no hate not supporting anything just saying u cant force

Just like the Fake Hero McCain Funereal , people went there to be Seen and Heard A political Event and to bee seen trashing President Trump. I say Fake Hero because sitting in a Prison for 5 years does deserve some respect, Singing for the NVA Propaganda Machine does not, Causing the Deaths of 130+ Fellow crewmen does not, supporting the idiot Obama's Unworkable Health Care system does not ( There does need to be a working Health care system, but not one that does not work ), Not trying to escape or encouraging or helping others to plan an escape does not, being involved in the scandals he was does not, dumping his first wife in her time of need for a younger and rich to help his Political ambitions, does not ( wanting to known as such a wonderful Family Man ), etc. Oh should try to end on a good note, he did support the A10 instead of the B1 for close air Support, The Total Idiots in the Pentagon wanted the B1 for close ground support, Idiots!

Pick your Hero's wisely:

Here is an example of person deserving to be called a Hero: Lewis ""Chesty"" Puller

Hmmmm When his Aircraft Carrier was on fire McCain ran the other way. Will do we expect a family of Admirals' High Profile son to help out? This man was never nominated for the the Metal of Honor yet there are Nuts who say McCain should be given the Metal of Honor. So should Tokyo Rose!

1) By means of war

Now, what part of THAT don't you understand?

e.g., 
Recently, a white female officer went inside a black man's home (claiming she thought she entered her own apartment... yeah, right) and shot the man dead.  Should we ignore this behavior becuz (according to you) there's more black on black crime than there is white on black crime? *serious eye roll here*

They intentionally create issues like this to propagate and sustain hatred.  Unfortunately, there are just as many leaders on the conservative side who are sowing the same seeds of hatred and wrapping it in patriotism.  This is not a battle of right vs left, it is a war of right vs wrong.  Until the world learns to let go of the hate and take away the power of these people we all lose.  That is why we stand for our flag.  It is a symbol of one nation under God, indivisible, and only united we stand.  Divided, we fall.  The words Make America Great Again has nothing to do with the economy or politics but is a clarion call to all Americans to finally heal the divide that has devastated this country for over 200 years.  When we all learn to let go of hatred, we will realize that nobody is being force to kneel, but we are inviting one and all to stand together united as brothers.

833.0,,0,2018-09-04T22:07:35Z,"It is always a bad idea for a company to take sides on political issues because they are nearly guaranteeing the alienation of one group from buying their products. I don‚Äôt deny that racism and police brutality exist; but I believe there are more constructive ways to protest other than professing hatred and displaying disrespect to our country. Not only are we conservatives going to dispose of our Nike apparel, but we will also stop buying Nike products. Nike ‚Äúnot worried about the backlash from a small segment of the American population‚Äù? If their revenue drops, then they‚Äôre going to regret not worrying about the actual large population of patriotic Americans. If Nike truly cared about what‚Äôs important to their supporters and fans, they never would have picked the liberal side of divisive issues‚Ä¶they would‚Äôve stayed neutral. Republicans only make up 27% of the voting population (5:19)? So, the Democrats overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump? I find that hard to believe; unless Eugene Scott is considering the other political parties (that are usually not on the ballots) other than Democrats and Republicans. I‚Äôm not a fan of Donald Trump (his behavior is often inappropriate), but I do agree that NFL team owners should penalize or fire players who disrespect our country during games. There is nothing profane about that. NFL players may protest on their own time in a public venue, but not on the field while representing their team. Doing so makes the NFL teams and organization seem complicit in such behavior. Colin Kaepernick was never well known on the field anyway. So, he had to do something to get recognized; and playing the race card (like most blacks do) worked. Furthermore, I wouldn‚Äôt invest much faith in Eugene Scott‚Äôs opinions. He used to work for CNN; so he is obviously biased and a far leftist liberal."

If you were in a positive black man's shoe in America being stereotyped and ridiculed for the acts of a few. Being harassed because the laws of this country are in favor the majority, but depend on the contributions of the minorities. It's taxation with no representation. Poor whites are treated unfairly like blacks, but race causes the poor whites to agree with the majority, and they vote against their own interests. I wish you could become a Black man or a Hispanic man in America for the rest of your life, and I bet you will respect the views of Kap. He lost it all for something he believed in instead of being passive, and not using his platform for change. People want us to return to the mentality of our ancestors, and just take it, and pray for better those days are over. When the players kneeling they are bringing awareness of police brutality, but you twist the narrative to change something positive to negative the typical racist thinking. It's no insult to the flag or the troops they fought and died for our rights. If you were so patriotic then why they don't be in the uproar about the Alt Right and the Neo Nazis marching with their Swastika flag"

He must have been high to actually think the NFL draft is like slavery. No one forced Kaep into the 2010 draft. And he got paid millions after that 2012 season. Just imagine if Alex Smith had never suffered a concussion against the Rams that one Sunday in November 2012.

Kaep was awesome...until 2015. By then, defenses had figured him out, he suffered too many injuries, Harbaugh got fired, and he had no pass protection--Joe Staley can't do it all.  Hard to go deep to Torrey Smith when all linebackers are breaking through one second after the snap.

Ironically, if Kaep were 100% white, he'd probably have only a one-way ticket to Palookaville...a.k.a. selling time shares and coaching orange theory while vying for the third-string position on the Montreal Alouettes. Faites du bruit!! 

But, fortunately for Kaep, he checks the right boxes. He thus gets all the attention, his Nike endorsement, and the NetFlix ssp"

That is disgusting. Also hell yes teams are going to see if there are any physical problems with the players so they don‚Äôt draft them and potentially cost them money. Also it‚Äôs not like the NFL doesn‚Äôt show racist behaviors either. Teams have to interview and have at least one minority coach regardless of whether they are the best candidate. Also you get hugger picks in the draft for doing this. If that coach happens to be the best person for the job and they are a minority then yes they should absolutely get the job over white candidates.

Idk why this video was recommended but it shows how clearly you all misunderstood the metaphor and irony in place that the scene was meant to portray and its sad.

Doesn‚Äôt even seem like you‚Äôre trying to understand it, not even a little. Taking it literally instead of looking at it from a birds eye view or even just trying to understand his perspective and see the complexity of slavery turned into the simplicities of an NFL draft (and beyond). The chains just aren‚Äôt visible , you‚Äôre still owned and the path of your career(life) is dictated based off of your circumstances, your performance and what you have to offer. Also goes for any job beyond the NFL within society  ‚Äúthe best slave , is the one who thinks he is free‚Äù Just because you‚Äôre getting paid does that mean stand in line? Money isn‚Äôt everything, we still have integrity. 

you making it to the NFL draft doesn‚Äôt Mean its smooth sailing. One mistake and career is over , your life is in someone else‚Äôs hands. Is that freedom? There are still boundaries set and lines you cant cross in order to maintain your status and also the leagues while keeping owners satisfied even if its against your own morals. its all a business and so was slavery and this is a modern version. 

Also not just the NFL, this same point can even be applied to the normal positions in society"

Face facts professional sports is still a multi-billion dollar business that exists to entertain the masses and it is a privilege to be a part of that. These players are an expensive investment in the ""SPORTING BUSINESS""...before investing millions on a player before they even step foot onto a professional playing field everyone in their right mind will do everything they can to research that investment!!! 

No different than us average folks having a mechanic inspect a used vehicle before buying it or having a home inspector check out a house for potential problems and hidden flaws. It's also a bargaining method, like cars, houses, and draft prospects costs rise and fall based on the findings.

Hey Colin!!! Here's some advice...

Don't be angry at a league that has essentially banned you for doing what most of us already know what ""NOT TO DO""....
""Don't SHIT in your own plate"" or
""Don't bite the hand that feeds you""

The ‚Äúleague‚Äù your gunning to be a part of has 0% owners of color (i believe Jacksonville Jaguars owner is the only owner of some diversity - Indian descent). The contracts that you get are not fully guaranteed and is probably the most physical bearing sport next to boxing and hockey.

Let‚Äôs enter slavery. You are chained and displayed to a room full of owners and assessed by your strength, size, age, etc. Once selected, you have to perform strenuous labor with no pay under heinous working conditions, only to meet lethal consequences if you refuse.

The only difference here is your paid handsomely if you perform. Sounds like an evolution of slavery to me‚Ä¶.

OH, and lets not forget roughly 2/3 of the players that play this game end up with CTE, which has no cure.

I heard Glenn Beck say on his radio show ""He is a horrible football player. I am as serious as I have ever been when I say this: I am a better quarterback than Colin Kaepernic. I am dead serious. I am a better quarterback than Colin Kaepernic."" 

A rich black man standing up against the status quo of the white man, threatens the oratory authority of a white man, whose purpose is to defend that system is so offended that he resorts to the sublime. Colin Kaepernic is a Super Bowl quarterback and a man of honor. Glenn Beck is 220 pound mass with a body fat of well over 10% and a pathetic mouthpiece for the system. 

As far as quarterbacks go. My sister is better than Glenn Beck and I fear I don't have a sister. Should civil war erupt, we should quickly find out what kind of soldier Beck is. My bet is that he flees to a Mexican resort with or without his family.

646.0,,0,2021-11-05T17:26:30Z,"Kapernick is a lousy athlete and a worse activist.  Anyone who applies for a job knows what it's like to go through a selection process.  The difference is: slaves were not paid.  Working-class stiffs like most of us get paid a small wage.  Kapernick gets paid millions.  The only reason Kapernick is invoking ""slavery"" is because most of the NFL draftees are black.  Which is, in itself, a profoundly racist and offensive comparison to draw.

We have had formidable athletes who can speak passionately and articulately about social injustices.  Muhammad Ali and Kareem Abdul Jabbar come to mind.  Kapernick is not like them.  He is not very bright, which is precisely why his managers prevent him from speaking at length and his ""activism"" is limited to photo shoots -- a smoldering glare into a camera lens or a raised fist -- designed to sell products for multi-national corporations that ironically utilize slave labor, and do business with governments that place dissents and minorities in concentration camps."

It‚Äôs not ‚Äúshooting people for no reason‚Äù either. There is empirical evidence that shows blacks are targeted more than white which is based on race.

Kaepernick damn near won a Super Bowl but ‚Äúhe‚Äôs a crappy quarterback?‚Äù You seem like you know soooo much about football.

He cared about race long before he was benched as well, you have no proof that it was just a stunt with no actual meaning and reasoning behind it. He made it very clear.

Lastly, he did not say nfl was slavery. He used the analogy that all the owners are white, majority of players are black, and players get little say over anything once they sign that contract. And just because the top few players get paid most black men are culturally directed to be athletes so they can afford college but it sets them up for this metaphorical enslavement of never being their own owner, wasting their life, and having to work 1000X harder than the average Joe.

By the way, Eli Manning certainly called the shots, when he was drafted.  He said he would not play for the Chargers.  He said it before the Chargers drafted him, and repeated it after he was drafted.  That forced the Chargers to trade him to the Giants.

A game that is solely dependent on your skillset and physical ability is compared to slavery because they have to evaluate your skillset and physical ability? I am also a little thrown off by the fact that the combine is full of white people who go through the same evaluations.  As an NFL player you are a skilled physical investment worth millions upon millions of dollars where you are invited to attend.  Last but not least THOSE INVITED DON'T HAVE TO GO!!!!!

1129.0,,0,2021-11-04T02:39:13Z,Most BLM believers I just ignore but there is something evil and chilling about Colin Kaepernick that is hard to ignore. The fact that he has been so devout in saying he is a victim(even though he is a millionaire) sends chills up the spine. It's incredible how a millionaire will compare slavery to being an athlete who gets paid millions of dollars. The fact that there is people who buy all in to Kaepernick's extreme beliefs shows that the future could be filled with some dark times. Colin Kaepernick is the perfect example of the evil of certain leftist that is hard to bat away from as the people with such beliefs get more power.

Ask them their family tree history to ensure there‚Äôs no past criminals? Maybe ask them what their 40 time and how tall they are and take their word for it? The combine is and always will be just a physical interview for a sport where the main component is your physical ability. Go try and be a fire fighter without taking a physical test. Try going into the military without similar tests. Welcome to life, if people are going to trust you and invest in you they reserve the right to know your capabilities. That may be the only similarity, tho in no way is this reflective of an intelligent mind set since the two are not interconnected. What an idiot"

Sensationalism is used as a manipulation tool. This comparison between the NFL and slavery is a great example. After all, who will dare disagree since he made it about a deep issue like slavery?

I knew the answer and figured that would be the nature of your response. 

I've seen a lot of things I'd rather not have seen. And heard some too. So It's understandable when you have a choice what you take in.

I've found truth in some very difficult places. And the naked truth ain't always easy to look at. Its written ""For in much¬†wisdom¬†is¬†much¬†grief:¬†and he that increases knowledge¬†increases¬†sorrow."" Eccl. 1:18. Of course that doesn't refer to superficial knowledge/information and wisdom of our own making and preference. Its Knowledge and wisdom of the reality and truth about the world.
 We're pretty good at sectioning ourselves off into our own echo chambers,  mass/social media communities of choice.
So, yes. I get it. 
When I saw it, I thought a lot of people aren't going to like this, Colin In Black and White. I would have done some things a lot differently, especially that Combine, Cotton field, auction transition juxtaposition. 
Starting out  with that, and seeing him doesnt make it easy to watch.  But I looked at like ""It's His story to tell, not mine.' 
I wish you could see it, but it's definitely not for you. 
Had it just been about his growing up and coming of age in High school  it would have been a rousing success, a great story. Noone would have had a problem with it. The young man who played him definitely has a bright future in acting, if they don't blackball him for playing a young Colin Kaepernick (Joke-smile). But the story is interspersed with vignettes on the history and nature of disconnected relations between so-called ""Blacks"" and ""Whites."" in America. 

Bottom line for me, Colin just isn't good at ""being Black."" But anyone who watches his growing up as portrayed in the series  will see and understand why.  And why even now he doesn't come off as genuine, and authentic in his ""Blackness."" 
Truth is,  Black isn't something you can be.  It's not a color, (like white isn't a color). Black is a Condition. 
Overcoming that, is what it will take the ""Blacks"" you were referring to realize they are not victims.

Peace my friend."

Look. I don‚Äôt really have a problem with Kaepernick as a QB. He was OK. He was no Steve Young. He was no Joe Montana. He is far better known as a whiney little race baiter than as a QB.

What I have a problem with, in regards to Kaepernick, is the bald assertion narrative he‚Äôs chosen to champion. The biggest problem I have is that it outright capitulates to a non-problem, allowing for the ignoring and enabling of the perpetuation of the real problem. He‚Äôs not theirs savior. He is their harbinger.

,135.0,0,2021-12-19T14:01:31Z,"@Brad Christy 

OK. 
Everybody is somebody. Nobody is a nobody. Eventhough you say he was a nobody, you obviously think something of him, or you wouldn't go to such lengths to diminish him.¬†¬† 
That's some low key dehuminization, for you to throw shade like that.¬†¬† 

Who was he a nobody to? Not his parents,¬† his teachers,¬† coaches, and fellow students at his High School. Not the colleges who offered him scholarships to play baseball, the Chicago Cubs who tried to recruit him out of college to come play pro baseball,¬† not the 49ers who picked him second round in the draft, the 49er fans, when he went from backup to¬† starting quarter back, and led his team to their first¬† Super Bowl win in years. 

You characterize it as getting ""to ride along with a great team"", ..just along for the ride, as if he was the waterboy, not leading the offense as the team's starting quarterback. 

""Then the lack of talent began working its way to the surface."" 

Come on man, you're a good writer, but Seriously? 

Talent is what got him to the top of his game. But more than his talents, was the uncompromising belief he had in himself and his determination as a young man to become what he believed he could be, a Super Bowl winning Quarterback. 

¬† At least respect that part of his story. That would be inspiring to any kid.¬† He made it to the mountaintop. If you want to depict the falling off and rolling down the mountain part, it's OK. Everybody doesn't see a story the same way.¬† As inspiring a story it is for some,¬† its just as threatening for others.¬† When someone appears and literally refuses to stand for (a symbol of) what you believe in, you gonna catch some feelings. I get that. I served 20 years in Marine Corps. 

Like Ben Shapiro, your raves demeaning his person and accomplishments are relentles.
If they weren't so well crafted, I would think you were as much a pathetic, no-talent person, as you make Kaepernick out to be. 

To be fair, you did say, you didn't think poorly of him¬† at one time. Doubt if he cared or was affected by what you thought. Though he may have been flattered to know you considered him ""the world's most OK'est QB""  for a minute. LOL.  

The ""chip"" he put on his shoulder, was seen by many as disrespectful, but it did not cause him to lose ""Everybody's"" respect. Some say he gained some.
Either way you shouldn't use false overarching generalizations to support your feelings.¬† You may be one helluva guy, but I don't think he was affected in the least by your loss of respect for him. 

""The NFL decided it wasn‚Äôt worth the fight, and sent him to the locker room with a hush check."" LOL.
That's a slick (condescending)¬† way to put it.
¬† I don't know your profession but ""wasn't worth"" can mean,¬† 'the cost to not settle at the agreed upon amount, was worth the cost and loss (monetary and image wise) most likely to occur if¬† e-mails, correspondence, and conversations between League officials, coaches, owners, and even the former¬† President of the US)¬† were disclosed by Kaepernick's legal team as evidence of collusion against him. But you obviously know that. 

The NFL is not a ""theme park"" any more than the NFL Combine is a slave auction. You can save that¬† strawman with the broken arm comparison for someone who cares to argue your point. 

But, You are absolutely right, when a major corporate entity or organization like the NFL agrees to a settlement, especially in this case with Colin Kaepernick, it doesn‚Äôt mean they are admitting to having done anything wrong. 
But what it would prevent, is¬† going through with the case to show ""collusion,"" and allow Kaepernick's attorneys to show they were right. 

People are going to believe what they want to believe.
And if I'm following what you're saying,... 

You believe Colin Kaepernick is a Nobody. At best and at one time you thought him to be the world's OK'est QB. Who¬† after hitching a ride with a good team, rode along to achieve a Super Bowl victory and several fairly succesful seasons after that.¬† Until his lack of talent surfaced, he eventually began to fail as a starting NFL QB, fell from grace, and found a ""chip""¬† he could cash in on, for self relevance sake.

I try not to argue against what people choose to believe. To me a persons beliefs are at the core of who they are.¬† I cant directly experience what their truth is. I might not know the truth of Kaepernick's story or your view of it. But in seeking the truth, it becomes ""self-evident,"" some people's truths are just well crafted lies. 

""...you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.""

Please. I'm not a Kaepernick fan. I'm not arguing for or defending him. It's the seemingly Haters that say stuff to prove how bad and unsuccessful he was, I sometimes respond to just to see how in their feelings they are about this guy. 

""A flash in the pan, second worst backup Quarterback,.hot for a minute for lack of a better option."" YOU ACTUALLY WROTE THAT!

""Kaepernick BEGAN his professional football career AS a BACKUP QUARTERBACK to¬†Alex Smith, and BECAME the 49ers' STARTER in the MIDDLE of the¬†2012 SEASON ¬†after Smith suffered a¬†concussion. He then remained the team's starting quarterback for the rest of the season, LEADING the TEAM TO THEIR FIRST ¬†SUPER BOWL ¬†APPEARANCE SINCE ¬†1994. During the¬†2013 season, his FIRST FULL SEASON as a starter, Kaepernick HELPED the 49ERS REACH THE ¬†NFC CHAMPIONSHIP Game. Over the next three seasons, Kaepernick lost and won back his starting job, with the 49ers missing the playoffs for three years consecutively.""

You obviously know the story after that. He took that knee. Nobody  wanted anything to do with him. His performance may not have gotten him a QB job, but the NFL weren't going to disclose the contents of the depositions that were incriminating against them.
That wasn't worth the money they settled on and payed him.

""Kaepernick‚Äôs career consisted of 58 starts in the 71 games since he took over for Alex Smith during the 2012 season. In Kaepernick‚Äôs first season as the starter, the 49ers advanced to the Super Bowl, as he posted a 98.3 passer rating in seven starts. He rushed for an NFL quarterback-record 181 yards against the Green Bay Packers in his first playoff start.
Kaepernick‚Äôs best full season as a starter was 2013 when he threw a career-best 21 touchdown passes with eight interceptions for a 91.6 passer rating.
The 49ers went 21-8 in Kaepernick‚Äôs first two seasons as the starter, including a playoff record of 4-2. In his final season with the 49ers, they went 1-10 in games he started.
Surely, Kaepernick‚Äôs style of play wasn‚Äôt a fit for some coaches. Also, it is fair to surmise, his form of peaceful protest did not fit the styles of many other owners.""

And by the way  by the NFL  TAPPING OUT, I meant paid him a settlement rather than have evidence revealed concerning his case against them Blackballing him from the league. He won his case against the NFL."

Let's not assume or act like when people use words (and pictures), the words they use convey exactly what they meant to say. Or even if we know what the words mean, we know the point they were trying to convey. 
There are a whole lot of different dynamics at play. The power dynamic associated with choices. The dynamics of all the people involved in making choices about, Who gets to play, When, Where, and How. In a League, agents, coaches and owners are primarily interested in who's going to produce the biggest pay day for all involved. It wasn't always that way. People's cultural and ""racial"" biases held sway over who is the better performer. $ trumps most of that now. But not all of that. People are people. Don't think for a minute some of those biases don't exist to day. It's not as profitable.
Money can buy you privileges, but privilege aint giving up power for money. Money (""dollars"") can be made cheaply. Power can costs people's lives."

He was a second round draft pick and brought his team to 3 nfc chips and a superbowl. Coaching changes often implicate a quarterback change. Colin went from a quarterback that was allowed to improvise with his feet, to a strict pocket passer with no outlet routes to help him find easy second options if his first wasn't there and couldn't scramble. Thats bad coaching and chip Kelly was a garbage coach who clearly had no idea what he was doing. When he earned his starting job back,, his stats were IDENTICAL AND SLIGHTLY BETTER than Jimmy Gs first 8 games as a niner, who they traded a second round pick for. This just shows they got rid of him for political reasons. Not football reasons. When politics and incompetence in the locker room become the reason why the best players aren't on the field,, and we live in a country where you are literally allowed to exercise freedoms to have your voice heard, it shouldn't be so upsetting to you if you believe in those basic freedoms, and competence in things we admire, like athletics. It wasn't racist over night. There were things happening during that time that he decided to simultaneously protest. Thank God we have the right to do so yeah? Simple people just got mad cuz they love football and Merica so much, they have been blinded by nationalism and fascism. And if you're arguing that colored people aren't getting murdered by police meant to protect them, or try to justify it in any way that takes from the clear suffering and systematic discrimination people have gone thru, you're just a statistical cherry picking ignoramus.

Ben I've been  a huge fan of yours for a long time now and 95% of the time agree with what you say, but when you start chatting nonsense and become hypocritical and tell stories to fit your narrative, you start to loose fans. It's easy to not see the problem when you dont look for the problem. I'm subscribed to the lackluster channel and it's a non  biased YouTube channel that tells police interactions and breaks them down by law, what citizens are required to do by law. Police are the biggest escalators in America, they approach cars with guns drawn, they arrest people for excersicing their rights. They will 100 percent murder you , fabricate lies that you had a gun and falsify reports so it makes their clame more true. Thinking somebody has a gun isnt an excuse for killing somebody for no reason , for that case all  a cop has to do is murder people say I thought they had a gun and now that cop has murdered you for a reason . I'm not black and I'm not even American,  I can see all the way from across the Atlantic that your policenofficers are dirt"

The problem behind the condition of black people is their 73% illegitimacy rate. They have no family structure. Is that the cops fault too? Have you walked the streets in cities like Chicago, Detroit, Baltimore? The worst and most dangerous areas is where black people reside. Because you are an excuse-maker for blacks, you will dismiss my points as coming from a racist. That is the problem in this country. The facts that I have mentioned are always clouded and dismissed as racist so nobody does anything about it."

I was really hoping that I wouldn‚Äôt have to disclose this, but since nobody here has no clue as to what Mr. Kaepernick is going through, I have to reveal first hand knowledge of watching just a few feet away, why Mr. Kaepernick had to endure.  I am a former NFL outside linebacker who is white, that witnessed several atrocities being done to my fellow teammates of color.  Participating in the NFL combine is something all players do, including myself.  It was very disturbing watching my fellow colleagues, who were black, being treated very differently then their white colleagues.  I witnessed my fellow colleagues of color being emotionally, and verbally abused by white coaches, and managers.  They were repeatedly called ni***r, and were the victims of degrading ethnic jokes.  I was disgusted with what I was seeing.  Mr. Kaepernick had it the worst.  Being called a traitor, ni***r over and over, and overhearing coaches and managers doing everything in their power to sabotage Mr. Karpernick‚Äôs career in the NFL.  I could not stand by quietly, watching this abuse day after day.  I had to speak up and defend my fellow teammates/colleagues.  I did, and it was only a couple of days later that I was ostracized from the NFL.  I retired shortly after.  Nobody should have to go through what black players in the NFL go through, especially Mr. Kaepernick.  Mr. Kaepernick was their scapegoat, and they made sure that he never played another down in the NFL.  Please don‚Äôt ask me who I am.  I prefer to stay anonymous for fear of my and my families safety.  I only ask that people read through the lines, and make sure they know the facts before criticizing an NFL player of color.  Thank you."

Do you get what I'm saying? No matter which way you cut it it's not racism nor slavery... it's disrespectful to the ones that suffered in the past to even compare the both... wake up son, I've played all kinds of sports and the same thing is done to players in all of them... it's called *BEING JUDGED* on your attributes, *not slavery* ... no one, i said no one, needs to go through an NFL combine or even be in the NFL to know that, because I'm judged on my attributes everyday at my own job, i don't need to be a player to know that feeling"

The quantum‚Äôs with how they only recognize from one tribe drastically halves the percentage of American Indian that one has. While board members can vote to keep blood quantum it was introduced by the government and they are manipulative in their wording of how funding is affected.  I keep up on what‚Äôs going on with my particular tribe and this is a huge deal. I would encourage you to keep up on your own tribe because this isn‚Äôt only an issue for the Assiniboine and Sioux (Lakota, Nakota, and Dakota tribes).  If you don‚Äôt see this as an issue, you also don‚Äôt understand how this affects how the language and culture is passed down.

You have 1/8th (1/16 x2 = 1/8th). If you have zero but your spouse is 1/4th, your kids are 1/8th. But it would have to also be the same tribe.

Tribes aren‚Äôt large enough for members to continue to marry within the tribes without marrying relatives. This leaves members to have to marry from other tribes or marry non- American Indians.

2103.0,,110,2021-11-02T13:50:51Z,I‚Äôve gone through that ‚Äúdraft process‚Äù every time I‚Äôve applied for a job.
,322.0,0,2021-11-06T14:45:35Z,"@Big Sweet C I‚Äôm not trying to be an ass here, because I understand that most people don‚Äôt know the ins and outs of these things. But a lot of them can afford to do that. Especially now with the NIL rules in college and the ability to sell signed memorabilia due to the fact that each NFL-potential-draftee is likely a star at his own school. But they have tons of options, including taking out insurance on their careers, or even taking out a loan from their agent if they‚Äôd like to sit a year because they got drafted by a team that they don‚Äôt think would be best for them. The issue of being forced to play for a team that drafts them impacts mostly the guys at the top because they are so sought after, but the advance from an agent I just mentioned is in play there because agents understand that these guys are going to sign a decent sized rookie contract. As for the other guys drafted later ‚Äî they could still go for that option ‚Äî but they are even more drafted by scheme and can also talk to teams a bit more about fit for themselves if they really wanted to. Players do this all the time, even at the top. If you are a nose tackle or true MLB, you hear all the time about the desire to go to the best fit. The NT would probably want to go to a team that plays a 3-4 and the MLB a 4-3. These things don‚Äôt come out by accident, they are trying to get to the best place possible for their success. And again ‚Äî the guy who is in college and wants to shoot for the NFL, but is project to go 5-7 or undrafted who doesn‚Äôt have a back-up plan gets no pity from me. All of us normal people have to have a plan-B and even plan-C."
,323.0,0,2021-11-06T02:04:33Z,@ÂêçÁÑ°„Åó „ÄÇ„ÄÇ I‚Äôm talking about a draft. No players don‚Äôt have a choice. They for all intents and purposes have to sign with the team that drafts them.

Think about what you just typed..."
,326.0,0,2021-11-04T17:00:35Z,@Big Sweet C  and also what you said about a player being forced to sign with the team that drafts them isn‚Äôt true. Players are allowed to hold out for an entire year and re-enter the draft the next year. They aren‚Äôt obligated to do anything until they sign a contract willingly.
,327.0,0,2021-11-04T16:25:00Z,"@Big Sweet C  that‚Äôs like saying software engineers, which are the smartest among us are forced to work for Google. They could go work for Geico or a start-up, just like these players could go play for the arena league or the CFL, but the engineers won‚Äôt because they want to get paid the most by the biggest company. These players are employees, and the NFL is a giant company that was a giant monetary risk for many for nearly 60-years. They are making money now with an established brand/sport due to the monetary risks others took. Yes these men take major health risks to play, but it‚Äôs their decision. Many of us in the real world need back-up career plans in case things don‚Äôt work out. I‚Äôm in the middle of a career change as we speak. So if the NFL doesn‚Äôt work out for them and they don‚Äôt have a back-up plan, then it is what it is. People in the real world also don‚Äôt always have the chance to leave or go for another job whenever they want. We sign contracts and have non-competes in the business world. As for salary caps, I agree, I think those are bogus in all sports. But again, it‚Äôs a business that makes the rules.

It‚Äôs an entire separate convo to discuss education in the black community and policies that have kept these places down, but 1/16,000 athletes turn pro in their sport. I‚Äôm not feeling sorry because someone made a choice to focus on football and now they are vetted/tested by a team to make sure they are an adequate fit for their ‚Äúcompany‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt have my arm or vert tested for where I work now, but I bet these guys didn‚Äôt get asked if they are proficient in Excel. I also can‚Äôt respond ‚ÄúI‚Äôm just here so I don‚Äôt get fined‚Äù to anyone I come across during the day either."
,328.0,0,2021-11-04T14:53:38Z,Not really. The draft is actually the exact opposite of free market capitalism. I‚Äôm not disputing they aren‚Äôt paid well but players would actually make considerably more without artificial deflation in place because of salary caps and rookie scales and ‚Äúmax salaries‚Äù. You also have the right to apply to any job at any time. These guys have no freedom of choice and are forced to play for which ever team drafts them and only many years later when they reach free agency can they have control over where and whom they play for.

And everybody that's under the age of 35 that activating on a political rally or such should be arrested because the fact of the matter is that you do not mature until you are in your thirties and you can have an audiology but it should be following your parent's ideology until you're actually able to think on your own because a lot of people are just forced that s*** that right down therer throat like candy. I also don't think you should be able to drive fully until your 21 I think you can't get a licensed until 18 then even you turn 21 you get a full in provisional license. Believe me I was the most f***** up driver in the world I mean I don't really good but really really fast andi could have killed myself countless times and also drinking and driving and one other thing is a cop let me go after I blew .12 and he just had my friend drive and he said if he saw it he would get me but I had the same motor they did in my mom's Mercury mountaineer and my friend drive back to his truck and said his luck and I'm on a bank road doing back to my house and I see lights light up behind me and smashed the gas and never saw him again and that transmission was awesome and it could even beat a 2 door same year explorer sport and mine was a 4 door and they both had the same motor and we did several test so if you live in the Hagerstown area then please go to I think it's called Cumberland transmission but I'm not üíØ and it was on Pennsylvania avenue I think. Is have to look out up but they made that transmission work like the best auto I ever drove and mainly because when it shifted it kept the rpms up and only dropped maybe 2000rPm on the shift so it stays stayed in power windy like a cvt but I feel like it was better than that still. If I find find an old 99 Merc mountaineer with a rebuilt transmission or a different one all together because the stock one sucks asshole lol.

Poor, poor Colin grew up in a safe middle class neighborhood, with all the advantages of a successful family, with both a father and mother to rise him.  After going through the pain of living the good life in a secure  living environment, abused, yet pamper Colin's had to try out for the pro football league so he could see if he was good enough to perform once a week for millions of dollars.  It was Slavery all over again for Colin's as he had to run around the football field with other players, catch footballs, and be checked out by officials to make sure he was fit enough to play professional football.  Luckily Netflix captured all of this pain and suffering that Colin's had to go through as he was paid millions of dollars to be a second rate football player until he was benched.  Now benched he found fame again as a racist, and a Anti-America, attacking the white man and of course, the police, (the two evils of the world for a multi-millionaire former football player).  Then Netflix shows us that in slaved Colin's, out of work with a hair-do that makes him look like a reject from the Jackson 5,  now has to suffer his slavery again as NIKI shoe company sponsors him,  giving him free shoes, reportedly made by Chinese slaves; boy I bet Colin can relate to that.

""DON‚ÄôT TALK TO ME."" Im thinking I should take your statement as a sign to seriously not talk to you.  But I'm going to so you have a chance to hear yourself.
 ""HIS EXPERIENCES NEVER BECAME EXPERIENCED till he got on this ...I'm a Black Righteous Man Thing."" 
OK. The story primarily about his experiences as a teenager. I don't know if he experienced them or not. Maybe what was shown, as being experienced, lived through, and felt is all made up. 
Is that what you are saying. Because here you go with the self privileging attitude of denying what someone else's experience,  like what you say determines what is truth or not. While you're sarcastically saying/making  up things to say, like this ""IM A BLACK RIGHTEOUS MAN THING."" 
TALK TO ME.
Are you trying to tell me, you can't see, how he could grow up in a ""privileged white neighborhood"" and not experience ""racism?"" Like people can't be ""racist"" because of their neighboorhood? Are you serious? 
Did you watch the story? 
Being ""basically a hero"" in his town  doesn't mean there were people who probably didn't like him or think he was a hero. 
He was a teenager playing High School sports. How much of a ""hero"" could he be. Probably more than you. Certainly more than me. Is it Jealousy?
I think I get it. You think privilege is making money. Yes, making money can get you privileges but privilege doesn't mean having money. I can see how you can think that. Which isn't a problem, cause most people do. Like most people think what they believe is the Truth when it's not. What you believe,  you accept as true, but believing something doesn't make it the Truth. Keep living, you gonna find out a lot of what you believe to be true, not just about others but about yourself just flat out ain't true."

You feel privileged enough to claim, what you understood is what I said, when it's not. Of course it makes no sense. If what you heard is not what I said. That's how ignorance and privilege works.

What words did you translate to mean only blacks can experience racism? ""Only one race experiences racism.  My point was who are you to tell someone what they experienced when you don't know them ""white, black, or any other color, you call people by.

 Who are you to speak for someone else's experience? No matter what the experience is. That my ""friend"" is a privileged attitude. 
You assume your understanding is the understanding, even if you don't know if you are correct. You assume you're right. Just like Ben does here. But especially goes so far as to just say things that are not true. Being sarcastic is a deceptive way of stating a fact you don't know to be true, but get others to buy into.

The 7,000 writing in ancient China are also something to look at.   Ancient African writings are roughly 6,000 years old.   So, no, writing was not started in Africa, and so what if it was?  Where are you going with that little incorrect nugget of info?   As for the US Marines not allowing service for black people until WWII I do not see anything any of us have responsibility for that occurring.  I served 6 years in the USMC and it had about 10% of its fighting force being black...about the breakdown of the population of the US at the time.

Coming out of college at Nevada, he had a great degree of physical talent.  But his QB skills weren't at the same level and he was only able to have some success at the beginning of his career due to the system that the 49 coach, Harbaugh, was running.  When Harbaugh left, Kaepernick couldn't fit in as a more traditional NFL starting QB in the standard offensive systems.  Could he have come back as the number 2 or 3 QB on the roster?  Ya, probably, if he hadn't been such a distraction at that point.  It just wasn't worth the immense hassle and distraction that he kept fomenting."

Being invited to the combine is a validation of your skills and your effort spent achieving them. It's basically just a big job interview for a job that involves mostly physical skills. So what, get rid of the combine because it involves measuring physical stats and just draft off game film? I'm fine with that, I believe game film is the true representation of a player's worth. But that's just it, players have ""worth"", and that worth varies. If you were standing in an ancient battle, you want the big tough fast guy at your side don't you?

,461.0,0,2021-11-05T22:34:39Z,"@J.B1CK There is not one job you can get that doesn't require you to have some qualifications. The very nature of being a player in the NFL calls for superb physical conditioning. These young men train very hard to get this job. Everything about the pjob requires some kind of physical or mental dicipline, and OF COURSE the NFL wants to make sure these men are up to the job their being hired to do.
    Why else would Colin Kapernick get up at 5 a.m. to train, if your physical condition had nothing to do with the NFL. He does that to be ready in case the very org. he condemns happens to call with a job. He is their slave already. His life revolves around the  NFL.. Why else would he beat himself up physically trying to prove you are worthy? He is 34. The age when most men are retiring from that kind of work because your past your prime. As far back as I can remember. when you get a group of young men together, it will eventually become some kind of physical comparison or competition. 
The ""White Privilege,"" you think is so obvious, is not. Most of ones position is achieved by hard work and sacrifice. If you dig into what you like to think of as ""White Privilege,"" you will find that it about , ""White: book cracken, sacrifice, self-denial, job promotion, and whole family sacrifice, Priviledge."" That's what I observed from watching what most people go thru in life, as they struggle to make ends meet. That comes from my almost 80 years of watching the world go by.
     If you know anything, you know that a large portion of the world lives at what we call poverty levels. This includes ""whites."" If you own a T.V., a Microwave, a Cell Phone or a Car you are rich beyond the wildest dreams of most people in this world. Therefore, in their eyes you are privileged and have no excuse for classifying others. Above you or below you We aƒ∫l arrive at where we are by choices
    We all belong to the same race, the Human Race, and we are all different shades of Brown. Some light tan, some darker tan, some darker brown and some look almost black. But all members of the Human Race."

It‚Äôs such a blanket statement. EVERYONE who is born into wealth is privileged, they start with a HUGE advantage. Just being white doesn‚Äôt give you privilege.. just like being black doesn‚Äôt automatically make you unprivileged. And why aren‚Äôt we talking about Asian privilege? They are the most successful Americans, not white people. And funny enough black people aren‚Äôt the most impoverished, it‚Äôs Native Americans which I happen to be 25% Mohawk Native American, my mother was born on the mohawk reservation in NY she‚Äôs 50%. You think slavery was bad.. 90% of our population was brutally murdered or intentionally given diseases to wipe us out. You‚Äôre more privileged than we are. The point is we can talk about racial privilege all day, but it is not a constant. The only consistent privilege comes from wealth.

The NFL didn't start until 1920.

If you find your wife put poison in your soup and you catch her.  The solution is not to stop serving you soup.   She will poison your milk.  Because she wants to poison you.  
So if the symptom was barring employment in the NFL and Marine Corps,  you have to identify the new ways this same hate group and their family is trying to harm you.
Racism in America did not end in the 1940's when the military desegregated.

The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) is an estimate of how well your kidneys are working.
Race is included in eGFR calculations because clinical trials demonstrated that Black/African American people can have, on average, higher levels of creatinine in their blood due to differences in muscle mass, diet, and the way the kidneys eliminate creatinine."
,692.0,0,2021-11-08T23:24:02Z,"@Big Daddy Why are you so hung on race for? It's irrelevant. Remember, it's for weak minded people. You agreed to that. So why are you still talking about it as if it actually has something to do with this? 
The old Marine Corps policy, and the old NFL policy are no longer in effect. Irrelevant.
Prostitution and NFL are two totally different things. Someone doesn't train their whole lives to become a street rat. That shit is usually circumstantial, at best. Also irrelevant. 
Just face it, NFL isn't slavery. It's not exploiting the players either. At best, the NFL is exploiting taxpayers. Most NFL stadiums are built with taxpayer dollars. But that is also irrelevant for this conversation."

I don‚Äôt believe that these sports athletics are otherwise should protest while employed on the actual football field or at their place of employment.   I am not allowed to protest at my job and guess what if I do I will get fired. Celebrities and Sports Athletics are NOT exempt.  As the old saying goes ‚Ä¶.‚Äù There is time and place for everything‚Äù.  Athletics should stick to playing sports (or otherwise) and go out into their community and protest and take part in such protest when needed.  

When I go to an event, sports, the theater or otherwise I am there to see and enjoy that event and to get away from ALL of the politics for a moment.  That‚Äôs NO different in a white NFL player (or otherwise) saying that they should parade/march and show off a confederate flag at each game; again, it‚Äôs there right (white Americans) as Colin Kaepernick seriously believes concerning black American issues.  If you allow one race to do it, then you must allow other races to protest their rights too.  The holy bible speaks of all of this:

Luke 6:31 New International Version: ‚ÄúDo to others as you would have them do to you.‚Äù

When playing football (or otherwise) leave your politics (or personal drama) at home.  These same people can go out within their communities and local churches and protest and make a change.  That‚Äôs what ALL of this is ALL about.  When I pay to go see a football game I am paying for football not baseball (or otherwise). 

And as for Black on Black crime ‚Ä¶take a look at Chicago.  Blacks in Chicago are killing each other yearly in the thousands.  Let‚Äôs talk about that.  Kaepernick should go to the streets of Chicago and kneel.

And now Kaepernick is capitalizing off of ALL of this from Nike.  As someone said in the media a few days ago ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶why don‚Äôt Kaepernick take all the money (100%) and donate it to the Black Lives Matter organization if he truly in Afro American issues.

If we ALL will take time to just simply READ and PRATICE what the bible says ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and we would not have such issues.  (End)"

Nike timed and played this perfectly.  It is crystal clear that they have they‚Äôve been bankrolling Kaepernick the entire time, and the dumb ass NFL franchisees (don‚Äôt call them ‚Äúowners‚Äù) were too dumb to know it! 

Now, the NFL is essentially paying Kaepernick the equivalent of Aaron Rogers money for the next several years, and will still get sued to the tune of about $600M.

Punitive damages and ‚Äútreble‚Äù damages are a bitch!  Let‚Äôs say he gets an award of $100M in lost salary for his destroyed career.  He‚Äôs going to get at least that in punitive damages, which makes the award $200M.  Add treble damages - which triple the award - and Kaepernick walks away with $600M in cold hard cash.  The NFZl will have to pay Mark Geragos‚Äôs legal fees, as well! 

Kaepernick might wind up being a billionaire within 10 years!  That‚Äôs gangsta!"

Its not about Patriotism, its about political and social injustice.. laws need to change, and how officers in this nation treat people needs to change.. Nike gets it.. they know odds are always stacked against people and they point that out very much so in the commercial with Colin, to reach for something greater and not settling for mediocre.. to be the best you can be.. to be all you can be.. think big, dream big and then go out and do it..  this countries justice system is not headed in the right directly at all.. Colin clearly sees it as does the majority of the people of this nation.. we all see it daily on the internet with cops beating some old lady or man, and killing some kid or family pet..  and the courts under Admiralty Maritime Law because they are foreign agents working in America just like the United States is a foreign corporation and has to operate as well under Admiralty Maritime Law.. which is why you will always see any office with the US flag and gold trim on it.. it has meaning.. and in court, you board their ship in foreign waters when you cross the BAR.. The US constitution calls for the common law.. not admiralty Maritime Law.. the prison system would be close to empty under the common law.. no victim, no crime..  You people all need to get on the internet and understand what is taking place in the courts in America.. its all fraud from start to finish..  did you know just taking a plea deal, when innocent and you plead guilty for a lower sentence you are actually committing perjury?  They are telling you to commit perjury to take their deal..   I could write you a book here, but I will spare you.. go study what is taking place in the courts and what laws they are applying and how these laws actually apply to Americans..  and understand one more thing.. to be a US citizen means you are legally bound to all their statutes, codes, regulations and acts as a corporation when you are under contract with them.. and its a pure slavery system.. You Stephen A and the rest of America are all bought and sold on the stock market for the money you will make over your life time to pay for the debt of the foreign owned and bankrupt United States corporation..  who owns the United States corporation?  The crown corporation city state of London.. which is owned by the Vatican.."

1. Nike doesnt care about polictical issues, they care about selling. To prove it ask yourself this question, would Nike do this if it would cost them say 20- 50 pct of sales. Would they do this as a principle, we all know the ANSWER : NO!

2. This is the same Nike that is standing behind social issues in the US whereas they price shoes and have done so in the past with high margins that most of the ppl they claim they are now siding couldnt afford ( and probably should not be spending on these high priced articles). The same Nike that goes to cheap labour countries and not only pays poorly but dont care about the workers and turn a deaf ear to their issues. The same Nike that used kids under 5 to make soccer balls because their hands were small enough to carry out the intricate weaving in small spaces. I could go on and on but you get the picture and they still do so today. I have seen these factories/sweatshops in Asia.

3. Max always wants to turn it into a color issue : Police have been against communites of color..........um Max this is a social class issue and alway s has been. Go back in history, the police did the same. Its even documented the issues in Chicago in the 40, 50 and 60s against the Irish community, who may remind you are white ( were actually called white *iggers) simply because of their low level on the social ladder.

We will see what this does for NIKE but if anyone thinks they are doing it out of the goodness of their hearts, you dont know how corporate America works"

By no means is Colin disrespecting America. By kneeling, he‚Äôs demonstrating that he understands that the United States is veering off course from its original CONCEPT and it‚Äôs in need of readjusting. People who fail to see this are blinded/desensitized 
to America‚Äôs inequality. (Just because YOU don‚Äôt see it doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt exist. Yes, when a tree falls in the woods, it makes a noise).

Note: everything I said was literally said by Colin the first day he kneeled just worded differently. There was no excuse to have gotten his message confused. 

IMPORTANT:
Stop blindly following without doing your OWN research. This goes for BOTH sides..."

He is better than 95 percent of all backups and better than a quarter of the leagues starters. They make Jerseys for the NFL and they decided to stick it to the NFL for the I justice they are doing against Kaepernick. Poetic justice if you ask me. So you mean to tell me tho that because of Kaepernick being on Nikes campaign that people are being brainwashed enough by the media to actually rebel against Nike. Um. Doesnt matter either way because Nike makes the Jerseys For the NFL and the NBA so this isn't gonna really hurt Nike at all. They did the right thing by saying to the NFL if you are gonna blackball a person for speaking against our change for our society yet continue to go on not holding people to higher standards and letting all these injustices continue to happen, we dont agree with that and the week you have your season opener we are gonna drop this campaign to remind you that we help make your league part of what it is. Nike is a Mogul. I would say its like sticking it to the man isnt it  cause I like that Nike did this. They got on the right side of History. I am a Kaepernick. I am a rebel. And I am not afraid either. Change is needed"

Nike is one of the most racist and non diverse companies that you ever want to work for! I worked for Nike for several years and I've never been treated so poorly and with such racism and disrespect my entire life. Nike uses diversity and black athletes as a way to suck Millions out of of the American public while behind closed doors mocking and making fun of the very people they pretend to care so much about. I went through hell with day today racist comments and being treated poorly with this company and nothing was done about it because I didn't have the money to fight Nike. Nike has been getting away with this racist and belligerent behavior for years behind closed doors due to its facade carried by black athletes that don't really know what's going on or they don't care because of the huge amounts of money the Nike dumps on them. I wish people would burn all their Nike clothes and really see what's been going on all these years at this company. Here are just a few links to let you know what's been going on. I would love to have a platform to tell my story so that people know really what's going on.

Does police brutality exist? Yes it does but not the way that BLM and other Democratic supported groups would have you believe. I'm not going to post all the statistics that are available for anyone to go look up themselves but black Americans and white Americans are brutalized by police pretty much the same amount with white americans taking a slight lead percentage wise per % of population. So what that means is down to the raw numbers 3-4 times more white Americans fall victim to police brutality every year. But democrats would have you believe that there is a witch hunt for black Americans. I do however completely stand against these racist hate groups like blm. All they do is protest for criminals. And protesting during the national anthem is not the way to get people on your side anyways. Kinda like the people who stand in traffic.... No one will support your cause when your an idiot.

Nike is a brand and business, therefore, decisions like this may not be in its best interest. But they found the balls to stand for what is right. Everyone knows that Colin is NOT disrespecting the Flag. But they want this to be so, for the simple reason, not to address the brutal killing of black men by (some) police officers. These people that do not support Colin are upset, but they did not give a damn when a young boy was killed by a police man one sad day in Chicago. Did they give pause to think of the immense pain of Treyvon's parents as they wept night by day. When an officer is killed, the community and officials show great respect and sorrow (as they should). But when it a person of color, then life goes on. Empathy and Compassion, cant just be for white folk and house pets. #StandColinStand."

When will the Black American who are descended of slaves get paid. Our country is a fruitful land more than enough for this country and for this world. Black athletes  makes a lot of money for every body, while most of their community stay the same brooke, full of violent and full of drugs. Where is the true sense of empowerment for a community.  The Bible talk those who are strong should bear the infirmities of the week. A lot of people makes a lot of money off the poor!  Talk about the real issues. We must returned back home  community and TEAM. We must all work together , without running a game on each other.

Overlooked is how this strategy puts the pressure on Adidas, particularly with Kanye West's stance on President Trump. It's interesting to see how Adidas responds beyond their message of being a  community of creators. It's a good message, but may lack the depth of Kap's sacrifice to ""just do it."""

2. Why stop with Colin Kaepernick? I hear ex Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is available for Nike commercials. He has railed against American injustice and will work for less than Colin. He should be the next face of Nike.
3. This ad campaign does not go far enough. There should be a follow up ad campaign that says: ""Are you a Trump supporter? WE do NOT want your business""
4. An ad campaign that focuses on Nike's core beliefs and business m.o. (we make sneakers using slave labor in Asian sweatshops and sell to fools for outrageously high markups). We exploit everybody."

Also, why didn't CK protesting black-on-black crime?  It is out of control and supported by actual real life data.  What a loser, politicizing the NFL over something that doesn't exist.   Blacks, get off the plantation, you are being a slave to your overlords, who need you to be a victim.  Also blacks, stop fucking killing each other."

God is a nothing of a nothing. Humans decide how humans treat each other. The common concept of God does not 1 thing in any human lives. You can believe in it but to think someone like Kap should is disgusting like saying don't fight the Civil War or WW2 let God save the slaves or the Jews.

,144.0,0,2018-09-08T04:40:16Z,"Hey Davon, l can't speak for everyone, but what bothers me about the whole thing is not the cause, I'm surprised you went there, there aren't too many folks that would try to say his beef isn't important, but instead it's how he, they, have gone about it that's the problem. This isn't an either/or situation, it's not as you put it, to choose between the flag and human life. No, there are many ways to draw attention to this matter besides disrespecting the nation, the military, and the community as a whole.

The time the anthem is played is more than giving honor and appreciation to the freedom, blessing, and relative peace we enjoy in the U.S. (yes, the Black community too! Don't believe me, ask around in the rest of the world, and see how many wouldn't give their right arm to be in your shoes), but it also disrupts a rare occasion in these wicked days for a city, a citizenry, to come together in unity. You know, blacks and whites, Democrats and conservatives, whatever, used to be able to do that before all this. If only for a minute, it matters. If I'm in these players shoes, and I'm wanting people 2 side with me, to understand the issue I'm trying to shine light on, I am not going 2 attempt to do so in a way that is going to offend, even if I don't agree with why they are offended. It just makes no sense, I would be spinning my wheels in the mud to do so. It's like these protesters that link arms and block traffic in the street, how is that going to be beneficial to the cause you're representing, to piss off a bunch of people that did nothing to create the situation you're protesting in the first place? Those people are not going to win anyone to their cause that way, and neither are these NFL players. There are a multitude of ways to protest legally, and in a respectful way that would be a hundred times more effective. Like MLK. Change doesn't always come easy, or as quick as we would like, but it does come, and God is a rewarder of those who love righteousness, and care about things like doing it the right way. Peace."

It is how a primitive who believes in ghosts rising to save their sins understands it. Tebow was not blackballed. ESPN pays him, The Mets pay him. A Broncos defense led that team with a limited offense, due to it's limited QB. Getting rid of Tebow helped the Broncos go right to the Superbowl. Not a superstition an actual fact. Tebow threw 17 TD in 16 starts. That is shit with or without Jesus. Turd loser Brock Osweiler threw 31 in 25 starts. But he didn't kneel for Jesus and get Christfags to suck his balls."

I'm not saying that republicans don't and I'm not one btw. I have to bring of liberals and progressives (not meaning all of them of course) because they are pushing a lot of this thinking on people. Where everything's about race and if you don't agree then your racist. All these terms that are just masked excuses like white privilege. It creates a thinking that black people can't get ahead no matter what they do and that their problems aren't their fault, it's because they are oppressed. It creates groups like black lives matter, that don't care about facts or responsibility, it just about pointing a finger. It doesn't matter that the group was founded on a lie because facts aren't important. The democrats use this and fuel this, so they can ensure they vote their way. Antifa is the same way. That's why they want to lower the voting age, since they know their narrative works on younger audiences. The republicans do this in other ways, too. I used to be a liberal, but the SJW craze has caused me to take a step back and helped me realize that I don't want to be associated with any specific political party."

From your tone, probably not. Your assertion is that Kap sold out, your assertion is that it's been nothing but a means to pad his own social status. Do you not believe there is inequality in this country? Do you not believe that Black people are treated racist by people in this country? And not just White people. Do you not believe that racism exist? Seeting aside your YouTube handle, and purely answering these questions based of the name given to you by your parents, answer the questions honestly as a man. Not of European or whatever your cultural background. Just answer the question inside your mind. If you answer no to any of these questions, it's okay, it's your POV. 
The for mention statement notwithstanding, understand this, NIKE, the top company in the world, sales shoes to 80% of most professional athletes, and sports teams, if not all, not even considering none athletes. Just think about that, do you really believe they have made this decision purely based on Kaps protest? Think! This is bigger than you are considering. This is not a political issue, however it will be spun into to one.  This is a Right or Wrong question. Yes of course money is involved. 
How would you feel if your lil brother was killed because someone was scared or didn't like the color of his skin. Or your lil sister was harassed and called names at school because of her skin colot. Think not as a tool of disrespect  and delusion but as a humanitarian. Gandhi, King, Princess D., X, JFK, Garvey, Lennon, Bill Hicks, N Turner, Ali. These people fought and died (and spoke against oppression)believing that this Country and World is awesome. They spoke truth against power. My opinion as an Humanitarian American Black Man, racism is very much alive in the world.

This is Nike basically saying ""Screw the NFL, we don't need you."" I can't express how much I respect this type of risk taking, even if it was done on a purely business level. This is boss shit.

I would guess most of these people weren‚Äôt Nike customers anyway.

Colin's taking a knee was about social injustice..  and Trump hijacked that and made it about Patriotism.. which was never what Colin took a knee for.. am I right?

In fact, I'm guessing his endorsement deal is larger than anything he could have expected when he was still playing. So I don't quite understand what you're getting at with that line, it seems so basic to me. I also don't understand how him or his family is suffering from this? How so? And what does Malcolm have to do with your take? 

Also, to say that the NFL is bigger than Nike is just blatantly wrong. Nike's annual revenue is more than double of the NFL's total annual revenues. Nike supports the largest and most popular sport in the world, which is soccer. The NFL would be fortunate to even sniff that market."

That‚Äôs the kind of person you and your people who think like you are. I don‚Äôt give a damn what you think. You obviously don‚Äôt know the issue happening. So let me tell you. We live in a country where it is scary to talk to black people. Where Hispanics are scary and they don‚Äôt work according to your president. Where all Muslims are bad apparently and we are afraid of a religion. That‚Äôs the country we live in don‚Äôt you dare tell me something else.

When you are white which I am assuming you are, you HAVE NO FUCKING RIGHT BRINGING IT UP. That‚Äôs the kind of thing we all want you people to understand. I wasn‚Äôt there trust me but I have dark skin and I am from the Caribbean and I consider myself a black Hispanic woman. So guess what my ancestors were there once upon a time before they migrated to the Caribbean. I might not been there but I see and suffer the consequences now.

Let me tell you the final thing, I suffer it everyday I go out and I see that one person looking at me different. Or that one person looking at my dad or my mom different because my dad is black and my mom has olive skin and speak Spanish.

,544.0,0,2018-09-05T23:46:19Z,except that he isn't protesting the flag. He's not standing during the anthem to bring attention unarmed killings of black people at the hands of police. The issue got so skewed that people really think he's protesting the flag and ignored his complaint completely which is the same thing people do when and an unarmed black person is killed by police on the news...ignore. Then you have the nerve to tell him to ignore it too. Shame

The guy doesnt care about his football career or he would have signed with the teams that offered him a contract all this guy cares for is his ego and being in the news his career was on the downfall so this is his way of getting in the spotlight by using this topic to manipulate people into believe he is doing good stuff just shows how stupid alot of people are for falling for this scam by a scumbag like Kaepernick

,561.0,0,2018-09-04T16:01:29Z,"EagleZtoTheGrave - Here is a better definition of hypocrisy... Claiming a freedom while protesting a representation of that freedom.

Everyone understands the cause, police shooting innocent blacks.  That's wrong.  That should stop.  Some will argue it's a bigger issue than others. Typically anyone who is more directly affected... like say a black person... will want to call more attention to it.  Great!  Do that.  Bring awareness.  There are 101 other ways to do that."
