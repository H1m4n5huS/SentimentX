181.0,,0,2021-08-06T20:59:49Z,"If this was the only controversial thing she's been involved in I'd have more sympathy.  I mean let's face it, Kendall Jenner is one of the most rich and privileged people in the world born with a silver spoon.  It's not surprising at all that Kendall didn't realize how insensitive this commercial is to so many people that have struggled with little success at bringing peace and justice to the extreme injustices that are and have been happening to minorities in this country and around the world.  
However, I also read that this very young girl just out of nowhere literally became the highest paid super model in the world (obviously due to her families fame and wealth) which also was the cause of several other models to lose their jobs with Victoria Secret.  
Models that worked hard and got their success the old fashioned way.  I personally would feel like crap if I was already rich and famous and was the reason why other models list their job.  
Far as I know she's still a VS model getting paid those big bucks.  
That wouldn't happen if those models decided to go union lol.   
I personally didn't have issues with the commercial but understand and respect those that do.  
It's a bit of a slap in the face to see Kendall had police a soda and it makes all the tension go away when that stuff just doesn't happen.  
As history has shown, people who approach officers in protests get beat, sometimes killed, arrested, and at the very least completely ignored and unheard.

313.0,,0,2021-04-04T20:14:59Z,Why is only Kendall getting hate lol? Sure she acted in the commercial but she didn't write the plot line. The writer(s) should be the main recipient of all this criticism. The only thing kendall could have done is say something about the ridiculous plot or chosen not to do the commercial. But then some other model would have done it and I doubt she would've gotten the same amount of hate as Kendall.

1. She and Kylie sold t-shirts with their faces overlaying Tupac and Biggie's faces, not only is that incredibly disrespectful, they also didn't get consent from their families to use Tupac and Biggie's images beforehand.

2. Bringing out fashion lines that have blatantly ripped off Black/Latin or Chola culture without credit or acknowledgement of its origins.

3. Wearing her hair in cornrows, dreadlocks and an afro and being labelled as a ""trendsetter"" and ""high fashion"" when black people are discriminated against for having the same style.

4. Then there is this entire ad, which is so clearly a watered down version of the BLM protests completely trivializing it as a social event as if the cop she handed a Pepsi to wouldn't hit her with pepper spray and rubber bullets were she not white.

There are many other examples, such as that whole family fetishizing black men and not to mention all the plastic surgery and darkening of their skin to it look like they have black features but not addressing the struggles, but I'm sure you can look it up on your own."

It assumes that a Pepsi could solve police brutality. It glosses over the reality of classes and injustice (only attraktive, young, healthy, happy people are shown) which is cleverly disguised by representing diversity. This is done by most ads but taking this highly political topic and instrumentalising it for profit is going way too far."

,172.0,0,2020-07-25T22:16:51Z,Violet Grubb yes! It’s trying to say Pepsi is the answer to police brutality ending and that’s not it ! Pepsi can’t solve shit.

Maybe the question you should ask yourself is, ""Am I really that dumb and ignorant or I just choose to be blind?""

Your original comment was condescending and rude itself so who are you to talk about maturity? You legit said “how much have you given back to charity and done community hours” as if you know the person you’re replying to and feel the need to put them down to defend the Kardashians. Just cause their charity is in the public and the person you’re replying to isn’t doesn’t mean that you’re going to sit here and make assumptions about them. Just cause someone gives back to charity doesn’t exempt them from the misdeeds and mental and emotional torture they make others go through. Also about what you said about Taylor being hated on more then Beyoncé or whatever…doesn’t make what Kim did to her any less bad. It’s the fact that she lied, manipulated and twisted the truth and tampered with the audio to put a false narrative out there to tarnish someone’s image and make them look bad."

She was wrong. Your rude comment about my head up their bum couldn't be farther from fact! People know who they can pick on and that's why the world keeps coming for Taylor.

What Kim did was morally fucked up to tamper that recording and to lie to the whole world and have everyone attack Taylor Swift when it was her husband who was in the wrong. The girl literally had a mental breakdown over Kim’s so called “loyalty” and had an army of the Kardashian fans sending her snake emojis which led to her going absent for two years. You’re just as fucked up as Kim if you think what she did to Taylor was in any way shape of form right cause of lOyAlTy, Kim could have chosen to stay quiet if she wanted to stay “loyal” to her husband, instead tried to sabotage someone else’s reputation and their image to save her lying and deceiving husband. Get your head out of their big ass. I’m not even a Taylor fan and I can see how messed up that situation was."

You can't tell me she wasn't singing Swift songs before hooking up with Kanye. That family is loyal to a fault. Especially after they have kids with someone. Not really sure why you have such a problem with this family - - which you are entitled to! My problem is when you talk about how they are bad people, but they give back a lot! Can you say the same? How many hours do you volunteer a year Ms. Medina? What have you changed in your community for the better? The fact that the Kardashians are vapid, vain, and wealthy does not make them bad people. ijs"

People basically were taking this ad as Kendall spitting in the face of every major protest ever, like the civil rights movement (which I think is a bit unfair and harsh). I don't think she should be the face of the issue, that's definitely Pepsi's fault. I do think it was a bad choice to do the ad.

It was a wrong idea because the pepsi would take away anything from the protest being talked about in the commercial. Handing someone a drink doesn't always make things better. This is a deeper issue. If she wanted to get involved in the march so bad, she should of at least give a speech on what black lives matter movement means to her if she knew and why most people at risk of this is a bad thing. It would make people have a better understanding. In my opinion, she should of backed away from it or ask the people who made the ad to change the script."

1st to use the seriousness of that situation in an ad to generate money is deeply insulting to the victims of unjust killings. 

2nd to make Kendall Jenner, a white woman, the star of said commercial is insulting in & of itself. 

3rd BLM openly said none of the leaders were involved or contacted by Pepsi before this ad. 

To take the hard work & protests of black people around America who are fighting against the unjustified killings of black people & turn it into a marketing campaign for money with a white woman who has NEVER spoke up about the issues they are mocking in this commerical is disgusting.

That's the issue."

723.0,,0,2018-08-22T20:29:56Z,im not saying what happened was right. but as an intern at a company that’s big i can tell u the celebs know nothing like kendall probably didnt have any idea on what’s going to happen in the ad. and she apologised so guys just give the girl a break honestly. people have done worse. kanye himself have SAID worse but no one seems to be talking. also she may be 20 but shes still young she’s allowed to make mistakes u guys. :/

Listen, they all got famous because they are rich, stupid, and have ton of plastic surgery which makes them perfect for all the idiots who love reality tv. Why such high expectations? Isn't the whole idea behind their appeal is that they are so far from reality that we watch them like some form of circus freak show? Personally, I hate reality tv and had not heard of the Jenner side of the family before this happened. I knew that there was Kim Kardashian and that she had some sisters but I didn't know their names. I watched the Pepsi ad and thought ""Yep, that seems about right."" I had low expectations as these people are only famous for being idiots, so why all the hate? You are specifically hating them for the reason why you all watch them in the first place."

Something she had NEVER experienced. She had been basically given everything and never had to fight for her rights. It's just a slap in the face to the minorities who struggle with social injustice every single day. It's disrespectful to those who protested for Black Lives Matter.. knowing how many young black men are KILLED & not receiving the justice that they deserve. It's Pepsi's fault for doing this and it's her fault for getting involved in something she knows nothing about. You can't just handle a fragile situation by hand a police officer a can of soda. Wtf. A huge company GAVE/OFFER (given everything) her an opportunity.. with such ignorance she took it."

A huge company like Pepsi making a commercial at the same time multiple black people were murdered by the cops and the marches were at a high was extremely insensitive, almost profiting off the deaths of individuals. To top it off they choose Kendall Jenner of all people to lead the ""march""? Not a protester, never attended a Black Lives Matter march, never really spoke out on the subject, probably never experienced institutional racism/racial inequality.

If she had any morals or values she should have declined this offer instead of thinking about the money. She can cry all she wants but there is no way she didn't see the controversy in this, it's insulting to even think about offering her this role."

,512.0,0,2017-10-04T11:42:43Z,"Because i think people aren't genuinely affraid of other people in general nowadays and unfortunately, it seems to work either one way or the other; people value power the most therefore are affraid of being disrespected by people of higher power thus that encourages  people to be more resiliant as they have to learn how to handle being less powerful and valued less, so they're more competitive and self assuring, (like decades ago). Now however, humans are valued more for the fact that they're simply human rather than valued for their abilities unlike the past and this encourages people to generally not fear society and family that much. What do you prefer, for society to be more fearful but more sensitive and less respective or visa versa?"

Donate to the cause that she disrespected, people have been victims of police brutality (that’s what the outrage over her giving a soda bottle to cops, right in front of a diverse group of protestors, was all about). No one was looking for an apology from this lady (the soda company already gave one). Her fake apology won’t change anything, but supporting charities that aid victims would. This is what celebrities do when they have made such an error. They don’t shed fake tears. They actually help those that they have hurt. Save the apology, and help the very same people that she hurt in ways that actually benefit them. Just one tweet from her, saying that she would help police brutality victims in any way she can (monetary donations would be best, but no need to be picky. Food, clothes, supplies, whatever). would’ve been more than enough. Just one sentence, THAT’S IT! No more, no less! Now THAT would go far more, than some fake teary eyed apology, months after the fact. No tears needed! And she could kept her advertisers happy too! It would work for everyone."

,800.0,0,2017-10-03T07:51:49Z,Bannia Peralta she did not apologize dumbass... she just stated what she felt...  she has nothing to apologize... she was just caught in the middle...
,801.0,0,2017-10-03T06:35:27Z,..... I'm pretty sure if she's apologizing three weeks later it's bc she never expected to have so much backlash? It would look stupid if she apologized right after it aired if people really liked the commercial so...

N dealing with people who have no brains. So can some one please explain? Cuz honestly I dont see a point in getting mad at this. Like theres more serious shit going on in America then this.

People just need to be people, move on with life and not teach the newer generation that they live in a world where they're being attacked bc of the color of their skin......... anyway,  I like coke better you?"
,818.0,0,2017-10-04T02:01:33Z,Gabriela Lopez don’t get me wrong I feel like the commercial was dumb af. But to go as far as ppl did is just too much. It’s just a effing commercial done by a privileged little rich girl who has zero idea how Real protest or riots start.   I live in between philly and DC and have had friends participate in the protests and let me tell you there’s nothing happy about them
,819.0,0,2017-10-04T01:57:58Z,Ricardo Carrasquillo You're right!  If you do the research you'll see that indeed police are not after black people.  People make it seem like black lives don't matter when really a lot of them have pretty darn good lives.  No one should be apologizing for a commercial just bc people are too sensitive

Even Bella and Gigi were on  the protests, but not kendall (imo because of PR and stuff). She lives good life, she's rich and she has no reason to go to the protests obviously. It would be better if a person in this commercial would be a socially committed person rather than a girl looking at the world through the golden bars."

So if you want to help end discrimination, instead of saying ""only black people understand what it's like"" maybe you should look around at the other races, and unite with them to help end the discrimination. It kills me inside that we have rasicm in 2017, it's a load of bull. No one deserves to be judge for who they are, NO ONE! we are all people, no matter how different we look from one another, we all deserve to be treated like people regardless of the color of our skin, Racism is not okay. #StandTogether #StandProud"

If they earn more, they should be paying more. In fact most corporations and their CEOs pay little to nothing in income tax, by either basing thier operations offshore, or tying up their value in stocks and other unliquidated assets, meaning they have no salary and don't have to pay any income tax. Their wealth grows, while yours and my taxes grow. Idk why you people lick their boot so much, thinking you'll one day be the factory owner. You won't. So instead of advocating for the person you hope to be and have little to no chance of being, why not advocate for the person you are now? People like you get so wrapped up in self ambition and greed you forget what can actually make your life better now, and it's sad really. Even though you're delusional, I still think you deserve free healthcare and education 🖤"

Try to pick up some reading comprehension so you can stay on topic next time sweady 💅"
,15.0,0,2022-03-12T20:16:30Z,"@Mark Your essay reads like a true idiot's. Who do you think funds the R%D subsidies given to private corporations? Investors? Because it's taxpayer money. Since the year 2000 over 80% of vaccines developed were funded through taxpayer dollars. Leave it to our good ol' U.S. of A. to make you pay for something twice only for you to say ""yeah but this is probably the best way"". 

Also yes, the U.S. is number one in cancer treatment survival rates, but only those who are treated. In case you didn't know, chemo is incredibly expensive, especially with private insurance. How many people do you think can't afford the treatment though? Because it's 1/4. 25% of Americans with cancer can't afford treatment.
So if you still go by number of patients treated yes, America is at the top, but if you go by gross number of individuals with cancer that survive the U.S. ranks near the bottom (going by OECD nations). You are given nothing but crumbs by your country and you say ""no no please, I don't deserve it"". It's pathetic."
,16.0,0,2022-02-18T21:49:52Z,"​@Mark 
1.) America's the only OECD nation in the world that doesn't have universal healthcare.
2.) America's one of only 3 nations in the world that doesn't offer maternity/paternity leave.
3.) If you immigrate to another country, America will still tax all of your yearly income for the rest of your life, even if you renounce your citizenship.
4.) If, as an American expat, you renounce your citizenship, move to another country, have a child in that country with someone who's not American, your child will STILL have to file their taxes with the U.S. once they turn 18. This is literally taxation w/out representation.
5.) The price of college tuition has quadrupled since 2001 yet the value of the degrees has lessened, while other countries encourage their citizens to attend university for free.
6.) While other countries matched up to 95% of their citizens' wages during Covid lockdowns, Americans received one $1,000 check, then one $1,200 check months later.
7.) 60% of small businesses are now permanently closed due to the pandemic. These numbers aren't reflected in other countries. 
8.) Minimum wage cannot afford you rent in 93% of U.S. counties.

You are literally given crumbs by your country and you say ""oh no please, I don't deserve it"". You are the socio-economic equivalent of a masochistic gimp. America isn't the standard, but because it's the baseline for all you know you assume it's the norm. It's not 1960 anymore. America's current standard of living is laughable compared to any OECD nation."

It shows a bunch of clueless young people who are joining in some sort of protest for the fun of it and because it looks cool, hip, and edgy.  Most young protesters have no clue what they are protesting they just know the jist of it.  This ad points that out quite well.  Not one of the characters in the ad is seen to be doing any research whatsoever before they join in the protest.  All ti took for them to join was seeing people marching toward a police line holding signs that say ""Join the conversation"" and ""Peace"".  So of course they join in because conversations, peace, and standing up to the establishment (the police) can only be good things. But in reality for all they know they are protesting for Kim Jon Un's plan/""conversation"" to have South Korea peacefully surrender and join North Korea so he can be dictator over an unified Korea.  This ad is a slam against the mindless masses of young people who are still living in their bubbles but think they have the world all figured out."

We, Americans, don't want to be anything like the shitholes you come from. That's clearly obvious with the results of election. All these protests are caused by people who will ALWAYS complain.

I think it is important to realize that social media is a phenomena that stems from hundreds of millions of individuals that are on social media to avoid real life. to say you wish it was any different is saying you wish every single person acted differently when not being spurred to. besides, social media means jack. if you get outraged about injustice online, then you are just venting that there is nothing else you can do other than try to get other to fight that fight for you. If anything i hope you take that frustration and set an example for others to really care about people they aren't emotionally invested in and start a movement that changes how people feel towards others. not on a grand scale but on a personal scale.....talking about syria on a pepsi ad won't shame anyone into action but if you are kind and emotionally generous, that would be infectious"

On the other hand, if they can not cooperate, western nations should invade and enforce democracy. None of these will eventuate because we don't peace; we want power.

Lack of empathy is lacking understanding or showing lack of understanding of other's points of view, has nothing really to do with differences other than opinion.  I believe you may have a lack of empathy as well....you are looking at this through polarized eyes and only able to see one thing...that it is making light of a BLM protest....when it doesn't need to be seen as making light of anything, especially not something specific.  The cops do plenty of immoral, unethical, and illegal things....that includes murdering people across the entire racial and ethnic spectrum.

3) pepsi thinks that cops attend protests in baseball hats and are easily approachable
......statistically, the ""hypothetical situation"" depicted in the commercial is likely in response to police killing yet another unarmed citizen.
if you consider yourself receptive, imagine your brother reaching for his wallet, then he's shot 14 times by police, then your community rallies to protest the use of deadly force, and pepsi says, ""oooh, we can totally use that, we can whitewash it, put in a model, everyone will laugh, it'll be great!""... you may not be offended, but you recognize how inappropriate this is, right?"

They talked about how beautiful Kendall was, which is fine by itself, but they were blinded by idolization, when they were assigned to analyze the whole thing, not idolize. They tried justifying the badly done message, thinking that Kendall was the one who fixed everything. Racism, sexism, general discrimination, this was ALL because of Kendall. 
This was in college. If this happened in grade school then I would’ve excused it because kids, but... college..."

One doctor is about to pull the plug and and just the one intern suggest the patient drinks some Pepsi, so they give the patient a Pepsi and all the doctors crack open a Pepsi and the patient who drank it is cured of Covid and everyone, all the doctors cheer and the patients family is fucking ecstatic because Pepsi saved their loved one.

Trayvon Martin (who had a history of violence, stealing, and confrontation with officers) tried to murder a civil watch guy and, as unfortunate as it is, got what he deserved. The other black ""victims"" were also lied about in the MSM intentionally to make it look like a race issue (it never is) or that white people/police shoot exclusively black people (they don't. Whites have a higher chance of being shot by police than blacks).

It's the far left racist Democrats and the MSM (with help from Obummer) who are trying to start this ""race war"".

Don't complain when there's another mass shooting. That's what that says to me when people disagree with the ad. You want hate and evil in this world. Disgusting and just down right sad.

,933.0,0,2017-09-17T13:01:47Z,"No, they were not blocking traffic. During a protest, you don't block traffic. You give in notice to the city that you're doing a peaceful assembly and get streets blocked off. This gives warning to residences. If you pay attention and live in a city where protests normally happen (i.e. a capital) you'll know detours to use, what days major protests are happening and when you'll need to leave. Protestors don't just randomly all decide ""hey, today I'm going to bring a bunch of signs and block people!"", they are rarely, if ever spontaneous.

Also, no, he wasn't fricking running people over because they were in traffic. He was running them over because he was a terrorist with little to no value on human life who decided to kill the people he didn't agree with. He was a monster, that I don't believe can be justified."

Not exactly something that needs to be hated to the degree people do.  The fact that so many of the younger generation are getting so pissed at this shows they haven't even opened a history text of their own country to be able to see the parallels."

I can guarantee you that not even a third of the audience even got the connection because they're too stupid to know about important events in their own country's history.

As for if they failed, they didn't.   I saw the connection right away, and i saw them try to put forth at least a slightly positive message.  That doesn't mean i'm going to drink a pepsi though."

Yes.. because that fact was lost on me.  I had no idea that selling a product was actually different than a peace offering during a tense time in history.

Perhaps you should read the post.. ""the idea of it was to give the same visual as when a young woman offered a flower as a symbol of peace"", regardless of the financial motive, the imagery was intended to be the same."

I guess the rich and famous handing out name brand items is all it takes guys!  Dang this ad is Propaganda at its finest.  I'm glad Pewds is calling this sh*t out."

5758.0,,0,2017-04-14T21:13:01Z,"To be honest, Pepsi and other brand-name product providers have done commercials like this where there product was the answer, and nobody cared because it was just a commercial. Of course they want to say that their product solves the problem. 

The only reason they care now is because they're brainwashed. Look at what Pepsi did. They took these crowds of idiots and morons out there mindlessly following whatever some liberal leader tells them to do, thinking whatever some liberal leader instructs them to think, and Pepsi made them all look like reasonable peaceful demonstrators fighting for a noble cause. And then they're sooo stupid, all they could do was turn and bite Pepsi and skewer them. And why, because they're mindlessly programmed to think Pepsi is some evil rich empire out to make a cheap buck on their protest using superficial pretty face.

But the truth is, Pepsi along with many others always do commercials like this covering a variety of topics from global warming to education. Is this really anything different? Not really. Of course Pepsi's not the answer. It's not the answer to saving our rain forests and giving people a better education either, but they use those topics too to promote their product like it's the answer. And nobody cares because it's just a commercial.

Oh, and don't think I'm for Pepsi. I won't be shopping for their products anymore. They want to pander to fools, then that's fine, I'll buy from other companies. The fact that they were skewered was only because they chose to side with idiots and morons before they did their homework to know what they're allowed to present and what they aren't. 

But don't let that deter you from making videos like this. This video was pretty funny. You can support the moronic idiots that march our streets all you want. Just remember, Democrats command the loyalty of the vast majority of our news, so a lot of what you see is filtered in an effort to benefit Democrats and the left wing in some way. I'm sure you have that problem in Britain and Sweden as well. It's hard to learn how to discern bias from truth, and it's never an exact science. It's more of a subjective intuition based in likelihood and that which you know to be true. That's why personal biases make it even harder to discern. And I am very biased against the Democrats and the left wing as it is today in America. So, you know, that's where I'm coming from in the interests of truth."

6396.0,,65,2017-04-12T07:13:53Z,"I liked the ad, why does everyone take it literally I mean is everyone an autist? Its not a statement or anything, it's fucking fiction. It wasn't saying the Pepsi drink itself can end all of societies problems. It was supposed to symbolize that there are times you can set aside your diffences perform an act of generosity. But these liberalls are too fucking retarded to see any of that and do what they do best when they don't understand something. Act like pissed off idiots"
,1288.0,0,2017-04-15T17:29:10Z,"+Wictoria,
 So because their job is to sell Pepsi, they cant use symbolism to ""touch"" people and try to cause an emotional impact to influence people? They have to make black and white- simple little ads because, YOU SAY that's their job? Have you ever seen madmen? It's very on par with marketing strategy in the real world. Do you really think that they should take your advice when nearly every study out there shows that this is exactly the strategy that works the BEST? Tying your product to emotions like love, peace, happiness, togetherness etc.

Message and goal are two different things in marketing and analysis. The *message* is obviously peace and togetherness, generosity in times of adversity. And because we, as people, tend to value those kinds of things, THAT is supposed to touch your heart, and then accomplish their *goal* of making you think of pepsi as a good product associated with the good vibes you felt during the commercial. DURP."
,1289.0,0,2017-04-13T00:24:44Z,"I do understand your point and it is very valid, I completely agree with you here, but i must say we all have our own interpretations and pewdiepie took it in a comedic way to entertain his viewers. Again, i agree with your views on the add, entirely, but pewdiepie was just making a small joke as many others on the internet were doing. Plus, it is just an ad, not a big thing. There is no need to elaborate on this level about a Pepsi that is a joke on the internet to let people smile or chuckle."

,1371.0,0,2017-04-12T07:23:21Z,redcrimsonscarlet The ad didn't imply any of those things. People are getting to wrapped up in their politics and putting them abov everything else. Sometimes you just need to have a break and Pepsi can be one way to escape all that bullshit going around.
,1372.0,0,2017-04-12T05:28:54Z,rock dot if what the ppl want doesn't matter then its not an ad
,1373.0,0,2017-04-12T05:04:33Z,"it doesnt matter what the ppl want i mean if the ad is too unrealistic it becomes ""funny to talk with others and have blast conversation "" and so it becomes viral , all the jokes and memes spread like wild fire , even myself i enojyed talkin abt it how stupid it was , but personally i dont care abt the ads but personally i think ... too realistic ads will be boring AF"
,1374.0,0,2017-04-12T04:21:52Z,"U obviously don t understand the difference between realism and verissimilitude. No one was expecting realism there. But in order to be taken serious, an ad must, AT LEAST, show some verissimilitude. Otherwise, it will incur the risc of being treated as a comedy job. What do you think Pepsi wanted to transmit? HUGE FAIL! Thumbs for PoodiePai's analysis once more."

,1378.0,0,2017-04-11T19:23:30Z,"It's 2017, an ad released on youtube counts as 'aired'. Pepsi's intentions unfortunately are irrelevant. Trump could have the best intentions by deporting all those people, bypassing congress to launch those missile air strikes in syria, and 'building' that wall on the mexican border but if you're one of the millions getting deported, bombed, or protesting against real injustice, and someone makes light of your struggle? Awful. And from a company as big as pepsi. It's the same as Pepsi releasing an official statement saying, ""Feminism? Police brutality? lol chill out, have a nice cold pepsi (and give us your money)"". Unfortunately the world isn't so forgiving for sizeable people, companies, organisations, etc. to be so insensitive with how they communicate their product. Might as well have made an ad of a medic team tending to the wounded chemical bombing victims in Syria with a Pepsi and everyone being ok and the civil war being resolved and rainbows and unicorns start singing. It's not about realistic ads, it's about the message that is conveyed through even the most unrealistic ads. Look up satire and parody for some obvious examples."
,1379.0,0,2017-04-11T19:13:39Z,Danny Choi So what if they made light of controversial issues it's just an advertisement. This ad isn't negatively effecting anybody in real life. Why get your panties in a wad over an advertisement that wasn't even aired? Besides I don't think Pepsi was actually trying to do anything bad by making this ad.  They were just trying to show solidarity with different movements and people took it the wrong way. Can you really not tell the difference between an ad and real life?
,1380.0,0,2017-04-11T19:02:17Z,"if u look closely maddie, the pepsi ad is actually shot with real people and not cartoon characters! with signs, motifs, and controversial current events that are causing serious problems around the world--- magically solved by beautiful kendall and a soft drink!
Realistic ads aren't the issue you thickheaded dunce, Pepsi made a complete joke of the entire police brutality, womens' rights, and trump protests everywhere."

But yeah, now I think I see what's wrong. The ad seems to suggest that all the injustice and hate in the world can be eradicated by something as simple as giving a cop a Pepsi. Plus, I can see what would make it inauthentic: the unrealistic portrayal of how protests occur, the way the ad seems to be trying too hard to pander towards the audience instead of trying to sympathize with us, the way it probably looked like Kendall was just trying to get publicity and a paycheck..."

Rich family living in a bubble... mmm relatable to 1% of the population, the rest of us have problems that they can't even believe to be true.. so they figure.. hey, chill and rot your teeth with a drink which has a similar name to the major stomach acid (Pepsin is a stomach acid, one of the main ingredients in vomit) ... ""It can't be that bad, they just need to buy things, lots of things!"" In a time where bullshit rules -  advertisers should be jumping on being genuine, being down to earth, being humble before the complicated quagmires of society's problems.

I bet the comments sections here could come up with a hundred ideas good enough for an advert for gross sugar fizz!

How about an app where you manage the cola company? Free to play but it's an ad, with the real logos and  figures? Like Adventure Capitalist but not just a clicker.

Or a video ad that shows the history of their older adverts, their printing press ads from nineteen dickity-five but the ads come to live in an animation with that sort of engraved art?

Or remake the logo through a worldwide competition, the winner gets money to donate to their charity of choice, and some money for their own work? Or they get to adopt a village in a third world country for the rest of their lives.. kinda like a cash-every-month lottery, but the company pays out to that village? It would cost far less than a jenner advert. 

Or an advert showing all the money they donate to charity, but in ratio--- moneydonated:moneyerned. 

Or an app that lets you get in game currency for some popular games per can? 

Or.. have an ideas competition instead of hiring people so out of touch with reality, they thought this garbage commercial was good? 

I bet you all can come up with better. Maybe I am being spoiled on youtube and other internet entertainment with genuine people, people who aren't being paid by some rich old crazies to make formula based rubbish all day long, that I think we should now demand it and boycott the real BS factories."

You're somewhat of a comedian so you should understand that comedians use jokes to bring up awareness on serious issues. What's the difference when a company makes an ad and brings awareness to certain issues. You're acting like the same type of people that bring up unnecessary points about anything. I hope you see this is the mess of thousands of comments. Are you making this video to try and spite Pepsi also?

It's because it's a consumer product, it's a damn commodity, it's something that has a face of it's own, and it's a ""want"" not a ""need"". The reason that boy gave water to that officer during those race riots, was because that child didn't want bad blood, and it was brutally hot, and that child saw empathy for even the people standing guard, boycotting all of the things happening around them. In a way, that officer is going through just as much as the child is, despite one side being oppressed, and the other side doing what needs to be done, even if they don't want it. You can't go and take something like a consumer fizzy drink, a FIZZY-DRINK and make it something so meaningful as ending a damn riot. You're a multi billion dollar company that provides a soda, you're not an organization dedicated to ending world problems. The biggest impact YOU can have, is getting your CEO to sit up from their bastard chair in their high office, and donate a couple million dollars to charity, and then make a personal ad, with the FACE OF PEPSI, SAYING THAT YOU DID SOMETHING TO HELP END RIOTS. NOT MAKE SOME FUCKBOY AD, WITH A CELEBRITY THAT HALF OF US DON'T EVEN CARE FOR. YOU IGNORANT CORPORATE JERK OFFS."

It is trying to symbolize that there are some cops that are not violent and that are out doing their jobs. (I don't want to anger anyone. I acknowledge that not all cops are peaceful and that there is hate and tear gas and violence overall, but I think that this Ad was trying to reach for the peaceful side of protesting. This isn't the only one, there were also things like the ""hug campaign "" that went out to hug anyone protesting. I know there are violent protests and that the world isn't all a shade or rosy pink, but this Ad was trying to ""show"" that we can do that. I KNOW it takes forever but we could. ) Also just a disclaimer I do not like Kendall Jenner -.- I am not trying to defend her, I'm just saying that there is a deeper meaning in this Ad."

So and good and evil is a matter of your individual point, my good and evil will be another good and evil than yours, in the real world there is no good and evil, it just dont exist, good and evil is generated in our minds a virtual thing.

So aswell your positive or negative view for society, its an individual thing."

,1789.0,0,2017-04-09T08:13:32Z,"+TheLeastPoliticallyCorrect ""un-provably racist"" - The Obama admin did a study on the Ferguson police dept & found there was in fact racist policies. I never once called this video racist, if you read my comment. But way to completely ignore US history. There's reasons why the US is the way it is presently. I suggest you stop fawning over ""SJWs"", as those are the lone crazies, hyped up my media to distract you from the real issues. The right also has their lone crazies, equated to the SJWs, ranting emotionally instead of logically. There's a balance to be found. I'd venture to say, as a socialist, we could find some common ground, politically. I happen to defend gun rights & be economically concerned. I'm a southern girl from Kentucky, btw. We need jobs, not to be divided over social issues, 24/7. _Nothing_ gets done that way & it's an effective way to divide & conquer.

+Critterz Feel free to make an actual comment on what you disagree with within my comment, instead of just insulting.

+dragonspyre101 Just because something has become law, doesn't make it right. Just see the ALEC organization. These corporations/lobbyists are literally writing laws favorable to only them. You should also watch a short video on YT called ""corruption is legal in America"", easily found, based on a Princeton study over a span of 40 years.

Btw, everyone, I watched this video without having seen _any_ coverage, biased or not, in any way. These were my own thoughts on the matter. I rarely use social media & only got a Twitter account recently to troll people, lmao. I finally started to use the Twitter account as my own, politically, but only rarely. I never use Facebook, either. Facebook was a mistake. It makes people even more in their echo-chambers & substantially more retarded."

,1797.0,0,2017-04-08T18:38:29Z,"Riot cops are just doing their friggin' job. 

Civil disobedience is done by activists all over the world when the situation requires it.  For instance, here in Norway there was a famous protest in the 70s where people chained themselves together over the construction of a dam that would harm the local ecosystems. Of course the police had to arrest them when they were breaking the law by trespassing and obstructing the construction work.

Sure, the police officer on duty could have taken part in the civil disobedience themselves to show support to the cause, but luckily, many police officers have a fierce devotion to the sanctity of the law and their responsibility for keeping the peace, and will stay objective when they are on duty. If they let their emotions and personal opinions decide their actions all the time law enforcement would be unreliable and definitely unjust."

,1804.0,0,2017-04-08T08:30:52Z,"For many reasons:
1. It's exploiting a tragic situations(protests against police brutality, politicians).
2. It's capitalists(represented by Pepsi) doing the exploiting - what they do best.
3. A rich, sheltered girl _pretending_ to care about these issues(if she really understood, she'd never have agreed to do this; she'd understand the severity of the situation).
4. It's downright asinine to put forth the image of a police officer being ""reached out to/reasoned with""(as if that can even be done!) by just giving him a Pepsi.

Police are, sadly, the enemies of many people. Especially those in poverty/living in a poor neighborhood, so this depiction is a complete distortion of reality which makes it insulting. At least the authority figures causing this strife for people are represented in these images by the police. Officers are porky's/capitalists enforcers first & foremost, rather than the citizens'. Just see the Dakota Access Pipeline protests, they are representing the oil company's interests & assaulting the people.

Overall, it was extremely poorly thought out & completely insulting to every person seeing it, who's not in the upper class. Money buys you protection & influence from our ""justice"" system. 

>inb4 the bootlickers whine

Yes, there are a _few_ decent officers out there. But they are extremely few & far between. If you're a decent cop, odds are you won't last long on the force. The abuses they commit regularly won't allow for it. Our criminal justice system has been broken for an extremely long time. I did read recently that there were some cops who refused to attack protesters at Standing Rock - fucking bravo to those men or women, if it is true & God bless them. They took a stand for what is right. Unfortunately, they may not have their jobs afterwards, which lends itself to my earlier point."

Let's destroy this type of entertainment and get youtubers a nice office to slave away in for next to nothing. It's not the lack of being PC that is the problem, it is people not allowed to voice their opinion towards others like they used to. Whenever we have an issue, we are forced to take it to someone else for something to be done. Even in schools, the one throwing the second punch gets suspended because no one pays attention to see the first punch. So, rather than realizing this, and letting the kids learn to work it out, the victim usually gets punished and the bully becomes encouraged. Now this type of behavior happens in the adult world, and this is what you get. Boycotting these brands will do nothing, and the change in numbers after events like this are just a study for big businesses. Reading what I just wrote makes me feel like I have lost my mind, but that is exactly how todays world makes me feel, with these childish issues."

Anti anything creates isolation and a will to fight against it, fighting against it increases the discrimination. You shouldn't judge the majority because of the minority; I can't remember who said it but it goes something like this: if you don't read the newspaper your uninformed, but if you read it your misinformed. I know for a fact almost nobody does this, but inform yourself on all perspectives and, taking into account your knowledge, pick what you think is right.

If advertisers do NOT want to put their contents on Pewdiepie's video, I am sure there are ways around it for him to still make money. I like this content, some of these bits makes you think. I do not care much that he uses foul language, expletives and occasionally swears. The quality of the content is what matter most.

If anyone actually takes ads seriously, like pepsi can stop a protest (which in the video seems more like a peaceful march than a protest), then people should be just as outraged that Axe doesn't attract a literal avalanche of pussy on top of your exact location. If people are triggered by an ad doing what all ads do, then why not ban all ads? oh wait, because we'd all be in the gutter without fucking jobs, that's why. If you're triggered by this, watch any other soft drink commercial in existence and then come back to this one. It really takes a special type of immature person to take an ad for a soda seriously. They're all stupid and outrageous and this one is no different than any other ad with a celebrity cameo. Share a Bepis with a COPPEr?! well I NEVER! how DARE you imply that some chick and a cop can share a soda in a PROTEST! UNACCEPTABLE. I would like to speak with your MANAGER, sir! Ok, ok, but seriously, it's a fucking commercial. get over it and buy a fucking coke.

But it has always remained - ""dramatic."" Don't know what I mean? Here. Tell me if anyone, and I mean anyone said this to you: ""The media affects teenagers, by telling them that they need the Perfect Body.""
If you haven't, that's fine. You might be younger, or just generally a little uneducated in the Media's Department. 

The media has always just been judgemental, and cruel expecting people to be the ""perfect person."" Like how they tell PewDiePie he's a ""Nazi"" because he dared 2 guys to write something that he DIDN'T know they would actually write. The media just doesn't see it from a ""genuine persecutive.""

We're basically giving a winey asshole on the street whatever he wants. That's how we are treating everything and that's how snowflakes came about. you need to show them how harsh reality is and make them WORK for shit, and deal with how life is. I'm not saying they don't have valid concerns but these changes about ""family friendly"" bs is fucking stupid, companies forget WHY they posted ads on Felix's videos in the first place. it's because he's POPULAR. They feed off of his fame to get better publicity for their product. THATS THE EXCHANGE. He doesn't change for you, you agreed to pay him for use of his fame...

10538.0,,0,2017-04-06T17:15:45Z,"I just think that we have to remember this commercial never directly said it was about BLM. Pepsi said that it was purely meant to be about unity and peace, and they may have missed the mark, but in my own personal opinion, it's being blown out of proportion. People are mad at an ad that was not meant to say that a soda can fix all our problems. They meant to send a good message, and it's not something that we should just assume was supposed to be a simple topic. I think that Phil DeFranco made a really good point about this in one of his videos. I get why people are upset, but this is all based on the assumption that Pepsi wanted to just say, ""Oh, this can be fixed with a drink.""
It's a really deep conversation, and I think these days it's important to remember a lot of us just want to be together. There are people who want to make everything a fight, but its just dumb to get pissed off at an ad when you should be focused on more important things going on around us."

51.0,,0,2018-10-24T21:52:12Z,"Guys. This Pepsi commercial was based on that picture of that woman who confronted and was arrested by those cops in the Baton Rouge protests which were started in part by the shootings of  Alton Sterling and Philando Castile by police. As we all know this caused a lot of upheaval in the African American community as well as in the BLM movement because those shootings clearly could have been avoided. I don’t know how much anyone knows about the whole police brutality movement and racism but it’s actually a big thing in the African American community and people were outraged about that for months. This Pepsi ad was aired not too long after this happened. So obviously just the fact that this Pepsi commercial makes light of the situation and shows people cheering instead of rioting is enough to be outraged. I’m not mad at Kendall; I literally think she just is uneducated about certain topics and made a stupid decision. People SHOULD be mad at Pepsi. You cannot make light of someone’s pain and suffering; only the person going through the pain and suffering is justified in making light of their own situation. Furthermore if the actual woman—Ieshia Evans—or for God’s sake ANY African American woman was used in the Pepsi ad, it thus because ones own nation making light of their own situation. Any other way around and that’s just mockery. The same applies to a grieving or terminally ill person. 
Also, imagine a pepsi commercial, but instead of police brutality, they show something on a larger scale like the holocaust, right? Imagine a scene where a line of Jews are kneeling in front of ditches with nazis behind them ready to execute them; but then one of the Jews turns around and gives them a Pepsi and they all start cheering as if the Holocaust never happened. How do you think a Jew, or even a Holocaust survivor would feel? I think we all know that’d be very inappropriate due to the fact that the Holocaust was so devastating. Well news flash, the deaths of  Alton Sterling and Philando Castile, along with all of the other countless African American men and women who lost their lives to injustice or for unnecessary reasons is also devastating. People have a right and a reason to get upset about this. Just because YOU don’t see why it’s so offensive doesn’t mean there’s “nothing wrong with this.” There IS something wrong with this. The problem is that only those who are or have been oppressed know the anger and frustration and pain that comes with your oppression being turned into a joke, or worse, a marketing scheme to make money to rich white people who have never been oppressed a day in their lives. We must learn our history in order to be able to determine whether or not someone is justified in their anger. And we, as a nation, have to stop labeling people as “too sensitive” for something that was downright wrong. Pepsi should never have even conceived the idea for this commercial. Period. And Kendall needs to be more aware of social politics and the issues we face as a nation day in and day out before accepting roles or jobs that could cause her backlash in the first place."

All america is foing is showing what whiny tantrum throwing babies we are! If your feelings are seriously hurt by a Pepsi commercial...ya a pepsi commercial, then honestly you’re too immature to even be watching TV! GET OVER IT! I think honestly people just want to complain about anything just to hear themselves talk! You could do an ad with a newborn baby holding a Pepsi and somebody would find it controversial.

People are missing the point of the ad - they’re having a PEACEFUL protest with everyone from a wide variety of ethnicity and not having any riot in this. Like seriously, why can’t we all find something more important than an advert for a drink?"
226.0,,0,2017-10-05T16:48:20Z,They literally are just trying to say Pepsi brings ppl together. There’s nothing wrong w it unless you overthink and go off on irrelevant subjects.

However with all the race hate that has been going on in America it really doe's not surprise me some low life race haters had problems with  this ad which is based on love and respect for everyone, and every race...This is hard for some Americans to understand.....My question is why is Kendell Jenner apologizing for being apart of a peaceful Pepsi commercial...Only a hate monger would take offense to the commercial...Kendell you do not have to apologize to people full of hate...it will not change the hate in their hearts and mind...Stand up for what you believe in PEACE!"
228.0,,0,2017-10-05T12:43:30Z,I like Pepsi .... I like the ad ... I like Kendal and I like the police drinking the Pepsi at the end .. he's hot .... any way .. it's not much of a big deal .. they are promoting peace .... if this was Beyonce every one would have been like yes queen ...
229.0,,2,2017-10-05T08:03:16Z,"I'm shocked at how many people don't see what the problem is.  And I feel horrible that they would drag Kendall into this.  Its not her fault.  If someone has never been affected by racism or sexism or poverty or homophobia then they don't see the problem of white privilege and how this is perpetuated in this ad.  What people are fighting for in protests, in activism, in politics are civil right and human rights that protect us from violence and discrimination.  So when a big ugly corporation makes a ""lighthearted"" depiction of that struggle, there is nothing real about it and it starts a privileged actress of a reality show... uh.... obviously it is a mockery of the struggles, and the pain, the downright physical violence that minorities of all sorts have lived through.  Everyone is pointing to the photo of Iesha Evans.  Do the police look armed and scary and as sh*t in that photo?  Yes... She is a symbol and the reality of bravery when she faced the police in their riot gear.  In the commercial the police are these twinky dinky cute actors with ball caps.  

If you don't understand the controversy please read more and get educated!  We need an intelligent and informed youth.  Pepsi shouldn't have made this commercial, they should have made a HUGE donation to the ACLU.  And to the education of America.  Oh and in case you missed it when Kendall's character (I don't even want to say her because she is being used in this commercial for their agenda) is getting all excited and she whips her wig off she storms out the door and throws her wig at the black photo shoot assistant.  You may think people are reading into it too much, but I'm not the only one.  Media is loaded with symbols, and this is another one.  Hollywood movies and commercials are packed with racist, sexist, homophobic, anti Islamic,  anti overweight etc etc symbols.  Why is almost every single leading actress white, skinny, and blond in the movies?  Obviously we live in a racist society where the white the character is going to steal the show.  Just like Kendall's character is doing here.  She is being used to steal the energy of the movement of social justice and sell you a fu$&king Pepsi Cola.  Get it?  Its so inappropriate.  No one can dilute the power of the real movement.  Power to the People!!!! Yazzzzzzzzzz

They create a movement based on a few bad cops but remain COMPLETELY SILENT about 5000 deaths (400 plus of these school children-mostly blacks) in Chicago since 2001...making their movement the largest living example of hypocrisy in our global community. Those of us with see through these facades should be speaking up much loader than we are...otherwise we're going to let a tiny minority of assholes define who we are as Americans.

Like #KendallJenner states,  ""Michael Jackson, Brittany Spears "" etc did similar ads. She seems like such a nice, sweet person. Btw none of us even know the ""real her ""!! She has been so sweet as long as she's been on television, in my opinion.  I highly doubt her intention was never to start any of this ridiculous hate, or controversy. I saw an Insta post where someone was so mad because she was this ""white girl "" . Fyi she's part Armenian.. that definitely disqualifies her from being that.... Instead of all this hate you're all spewing, and adding to the separation of humanity,  Spread love.  Speak like adults, state your opinions kindly, not trashy!"

Not to mention, this crowd could’ve been a reaction to any movement seeing as there’s a lot happening in the world today. The police are meant to protect us & I think this commercial portrays that wonderfully because they just stood there while the people peacefully marched through the streets. Honestly, what’s the problem? Kendall did an amazing job as well & obviously was used not only because she’s young but because people look up to her. This is more than just a “dig” at the BLM movement. This was a statement to the government letting them know that they can’t break us apart no matter how hard they try. Pepsi was just the only one brave enough to make it as public as they did."

I get it, because in USA, police uses asymmetrical force over black people, showing a police being peaceful thanks to pepsi is condescending. I have huge respect for BLM, a little less for Clintonite newbies; but just the facts that ""you assume this is disrespectful to BLM or you equate every march against police to a resistance for blacks"" are disrespectful to thousands of movements across the world (and USA) who seeked social justice and were brutally clamped down by police.

If you actually leave your arrogance aside, the only problem with this ad is that it is a global corporation's attempt on capitalise on protest movements. But otherwise, it popularises resistance against power consolidation and promotes unity. So criticise those elements but please don't try to gain moral high ground because of your own movement.

Oh, and these so-called comedians jumping into the bandwagon of ""this is wrong"" hysteria. Just stop it. You make your too insincerity too obvious."

People get killed, beaten, and arrested when they take to the streets to protest their cause, whatever their cause. The well dressed, wealthy, attractive protesters of RichSuburbia, USA are a joke. It's also so embarrassingly fake, topical and shallow. They take the symbol of struggle for a lot of fed up people and extort it for their benefit by turning it into some weird, fake, idyllic after school special. That's not what a real protest looks, and they're often not pretty. They are using social issues and current events to shlock their dumbass product. And then, at the end, it's all good, everyone cheers, because some out-of-touch, uber rich, famous-for-being-famous, nobody celebrity gives a cop a damn Pepsi. Like, wtf? Again, it cheapens the real issues that are being protested today. It's so self serving and self righteous and disingenuous and fake. Stay out of social issues Pepsi, no one cares for your stupid take on it."

I live four miles from Ferguson and hate that ppl are still talking about the prolonged protesting, the burning of buildings, & the awfully senseless violence that took place during that time. Many unarmed white men are gunned down by black cops, but do we protest or go crazy tearing up towns? No. Why can't we all be civilized & accept that we can't control anything beyond ourselves?

Stop blaming this girl, she is. not sitting on her lazy ass; what she is doing is called WORKING TO PAY THE BILLS. She is NOT

Pepsi ""SHAME ON YOU FOR PUTTING THIS FIASCO ON THIS YOUNG GIRL'S SHOULDERS"". She didn't realize what this commerical was going to mean to other's, she's young so I side with her. Pepsi on the other hand knew exactly what they were doing. They should have explained all the pro's & con's. They knew it could backfire big time, not only did you remove this ad you tossed her.under the bus. Gave her a very weak SORRY, and made sure you apologized to everyone of your customer's, again ""SHAME ON YOU, Pray that she continues to get work after this.

nigger or nigga which one oy ever choose is just a fucking word. It doesn't matter anything more meannig then you put on it.

Do keep in mind, ""my nigga"" is actually a super nice stuff is eastern europe and rest. Only butthurt americans tilt over it.

At this moment there are thousands of protests going around the world about thousands of matters, assuming it is capitilizing only from BLM is just doing a very biased interpretation of the add. I think the add is capitalizing on social discomfort around the world..Should that offend someone, I don't think it should..Why? Because it is trying to recreate actions of peace movements in the 60s, possibly the add is trying to reflect the recent protests in general: woman issues, muslim ban,blk, trump bigotry etc. People have to be very careful in what they decide to link to racism of appropriation of such problems. I guess there is a lot of confusion nowadays in the young population. There is actual unfortunate situations happening in our society, such as racism or homophobia, however it is important to always do a real analysis of what is being offensive and whats not. If not, we risk reaching oversensitiveness, that rather than helping the problem, it just takes us a little farther away of finding a solution.
I personally do not have a problem with the add, but I do consider it to be tasteless."

That's the problem. We know generally the office is white, but if you are trying to promote for leading a movement, why would you choose a white leader, who is a model, i.e. doesn't really represent society, in a crowd of different backgrounds? I think it would've been different if the officer was the one who handed the Pepsi as a way of bringing everybody together."

Why do we asume that every protest has to be violent..... on the ""'funny"" note : soo the police officer has been standing there for hours and was thirsty, so kendall gave him a pepsi... showing that there are no hard feelings, hate, disrespect or violence...."

And if there is going to be a meeting it's not going to be against war between each other, it is going to be for piece and understaning. And that we can be the generation that can change everything, we can make this world a better place. And it doesn't matter if you are black, white, yellow, pink or whatever - we all can have the same goal. You shouldn't be a gay to support lgbt, or a woman to support faminism. And a white model can support the idea that beauty of this world is in our diversity. And I love the moment when she gives pepsi to the cop, because she shows that we are not gonna fight, we are not your enemies, we are all the same, so don't be against us, be with us...

In my opinion, i do  think the excuse of saying that this commercial is an insult to the protester (""because giving pepsi won't resolve anything"") is honestly exaggerating. I am so sorry if i have offended anyone here, but when i watched this commercial, all i saw is that it promotes unity regardless of race, religion, gender or whatever role u play in society. IT'S JUST A COMMERCIAL DENOTING THAT PEPSI IS FOR UNITY. Obviously, things won't be solved by a soda, (AGAIN OBVIOUSLY). It could be that they're saying this is our (Pepsi) Philosophy and this is what we want to see in the future. well"

The reason why Miss Jenner is getting so much backlash, is because she seems like a self-centered individual and this commercial negates that 100%. If Pepsi would've stuck with a B-List celebrity or even a Humble rapper like Kendrick Lamar, none of this would've happened. Besides, it's all about Sales in the end and Miss Jenner does not make me want to buy Pepsi. She was probably offered millions of dollars, whilst the background actors/actress gets $10-14/hour for putting up with those Shenanigans."

776.0,,73,2017-04-12T16:10:47Z,"The common misconception that I keep on seeing in these comments is people referring to the content in the ad as a protest. What is displayed in the ad is not a protest, it was a march for peace. Two VERY different things! They were not protesting against anything at all, it was a huge group of people of all races, nationalities, gender, and sexual orientation. They were holding up peace signs saying join the conversation, that is hardly a protest. The pepsi can was symbolic of an olive branch or flower, they weren't saying here have a pepsi it will make things better, they were conveying the message of extending peace. I am seeing so many people make this into something bigger then what it actually is. Now if you want to see something truly offensive, racist, near sided, etc. then read some of these comments, they are the real problem. Not a company making a bold step saying that we need peace."

,91.0,0,2017-04-26T18:46:41Z,"People dislike the ad because Pepsi has taken the hallmarks of organic social movement and resistance (which has nothing to do with profiteering) and used them for financial gain. You cannot compare hippies putting flowers into the gun barrels of policemen with Kendall Jenner handing a cop a soda. They are total opposites - the hippies confronted police because they were rejecting global violence, government policy and, crucially, capitalist agendas. Kendall's on-screen action is entirely centred on making a profit - something that the hippy movement stood against. It also trivialises the problems and hopelessness that drives people to protest in the first place by saying that everything can be fixed with a smile and a Pepsi. For many people, protesting is the only way they can make their voice heard and hope to effect any kind of positive change. Pepsi have taken that ugly reality and turned it into a stylish fashion show that does not reflect the unhappy reality of many people's lives. Essentially, this is not what a protest looks like. Protesting is not something that needs to or should be glamorized. A protest is not Coachella. At the end of the day, Pepsi did not dream up this article with the intent of empowering protesters across the world. They saw it as a way to drum up publicity and cash. These are just a few of the issues that people have with it. At the end of the day, it doesn't matter all that much, it's just a stupid, misjudged ad. Hope that helps :)"

ANYWAY so in the end either she Didn't have Tyler the Creator keeping his homies on watch on her for this one moment after she's either  more woke or tryna kill part of his career. and  basically the bigger pic is the NAZIS prepared an entire social media campaign which a bunch of losers fell for..."

I saw a mix of races and religions all showing to be brave. I seriously do not understand where people would get the blacklivesmatter issue into this. Honestly people are just so childish. Is 2017 grow up there are so many serious things going on in the world and instead people to choose to focus on this? And I don't understand why everyone is jumping on Kendall. She is doing her job to represent a character or person created by the creative team that thought all of it up. It wasn't her idea or her thought so I don't see why everyone is going to her. People just have way too many problems these dad honestly the video was absolutely fine. I am a black woman and did not feel the slightest offended I actually thought it was kinda cool."

,133.0,0,2017-11-05T05:23:31Z,Isimeme Udu maybe people should just try and see what the commercial is for what it really is. a commercial that’s it. sometimes the purpose of things is to not take things literal but to see the creativity in it. taking things literal in life will get you no where. everything has a deeper meaning. i don’t think it was mocking anything mockery means to insult or make front of in some cases. and i don’t see how this commercial mocking or  insulting anything. and of course she just walked up to him again it’s a commercial what was he supposed to do knock her down or tell her to get back? if that would have happened people would have found a way to get mad about it. if people have a problem with this not being realistic enough they need to find something else to do with their selves. because just like you said how it’s “just a can”. this is JUST a commercial

Exactly, my example is similar to nearly every commercial ever made. This is my point, lol. The fact that ppl are upset doesn't make the commercial a mockery. How does that make sense? Have you taken any argumentation courses in school? Your entire post is full of fallacies, dear, not to mention contradicting. Just because the commercial received backlash by some ppl does not insinuate or even fabricate wrong doing or mockery or anything that ppl people are complaining. I cannot understand how you don't see what you have said it utterly ridiculous. Lastly, you obviously DO see what my analogy had to do with the Doritos commercial. Dogs were hungry and devised a plan to acquire Doritos. That commercial could appeal to many causes and could have created much ""backlash"" had it not been so adorable. Lots of commercials can have the same effect. I never said Doritos WAS making a mockery of starvation or thievery or grocery store chains not allowing animals. I said that the Doritos commercial could have the same effect on certain ppl as three Pepsi commercial. Some ppl could have seen it in a completely different light, as obviously many have in this instance or there wouldn't be so many differences in opinion on these threads. Pepsi didn't incite backlash. Ppl just want to see what they want to see. This is why our courts are overcrowded with heinous law suits...because ppl are too sensitive and always think the worst and ALWAYS take things personally. We'll never change as a society until ppl get a handle on their own confidence and empathic nature for human kind."

So, when Doritos did their commercial of a bunch of dogs trying to get into the grocery store to grab some Doritos,  were they making a mockery of starving dogs or even starving people...or maybe shoplifters that wear hats and trench coats? Do you see how ridiculous you sound? IT'S A COMMERCIAL, not a biography. Starvation and poor nutrition is also a very serious problem in many countries, but Doritos still made that commercial. I can give you so many more examples, but I think I made my point. Again, it's advertising, nothing more."

Did you expect him to punch her in the face or pepper spray her? It wasn't because she was white, it was because she is famous! If they had used a black celebrity instead of Kendall (or any other white celebrity), the cop still wouldn't have reacted with fear or violence. Now, if this were just regular Joe Shmoes protesting and marching, we all know the cops would react in a different manner. They wouldn't be so trusting of some regular person offering them a drink. At least that is what I thought after the first time I watched this. People of color don't want white people generalizing them, based on the small number of them that do things that make them all look bad. White people also don't want other races generalizing them for the same reasons. This is one of the reasons the country is like it is presently. Some people want to make EVERYTHING about race. People are getting offended over shit that doesn't even affect them. It is ridiculous. If people would just live their lives, go to work, go to school, etc., this country would be a much better place. If you keep yourself busy, being a productive citizen, you don't have time to sit around and think of stupid shit to be offended by. People need to realize this is the real world, and just because something offends you, that doesn't mean it offends everyone else. Nor does it give you the right to try to force others to agree with you. Sorry for the long rant, but I just wanted to give my thoughts on this. Hope you have a wonderful day!"

In some Arabian/ Mediterranean countries, there are people who get shot for trying to protect their family from terrorists. In Venezuela the government is raping people for fun and protesters are trying their best to help. This add makes it look like protesting is fun and people are literally dancing in the add.

It was very artistic and very caring and showing awareness to a few problems we have going on in the world right now. I just do not see the problem?? I can not stand the kardashian's success either but I never knock someone when they have done something good and worth giving credit for. I do not see the issue. I also do not see a problem with her giving the cops a pepsi. Idc what race stops the violence as long as it stops. I just am confused. Trust me I am the first to call out bullshit or injustice to and for anyone. I just do not see it here. This was one of the best commercials I have seen in  a long time.

1060.0,,0,2017-04-09T16:10:07Z,"I like this ad.  It supports that the elite (Ms. Jenner) can be influenced by the masses (all colors).  Pepsi is the common thread.  Something that everyone can enjoy.  It could be coca cola, chocolate milk, coffee or orange juice, the product doesn't matter because it's symbology is ""common bond,"" which in the end includes an officer.  Does anyone remember when the National Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam marched on the Pentagon in 1967?  A squad of armed guardsmen marched into the crowd of demonstrators and George Edgerly Harris III emerged from the crowd and placed carnations in the rifles.  Everyone knows that flowers can't stop atrocities, and neither can Pepsi, but still, there is symbolic significance in the gesture:  the use of nonviolent objects show that the demonstrations were not associated with anger or violence.  Thus, in my mind, the Pepsi ad is, or will become, as iconic as the flower power antiwar movement.  It's history in the making.  I'm just saying."
1061.0,,0,2017-04-09T16:03:43Z,"The fact that they have a WHITE, PRIVELEGED, TEEN MODEL handing the Pepsi to the OFFICER is absurd. Thinking that ONE nasty carbonated drink can save the world's problem. The fact that they are using serious conflicts that are actually happening in this world for a low budget Pepsi commercial makes me want to cringe. It sends false information out and it just does not help with today's problems. In a way, I feel as if it is mocking what is going on with our lives. Kendall Jenner is just a fake who tries to be involved with politics and stand up for women Rights, but probably doesn't even know where the root of these problems first started. She is probably only in it because of the horrifying thing Donald Trump says about us women. I am sad that some wants to claim Kendall Jenner as a strong independent women."

- The cop is handed a can and the commercial pauses, the muslim girl stops and readies her camera and they're all waiting to see if he takes it.

1175.0,,0,2017-04-08T17:07:33Z,"From a commercial point of view i think that Pepsi is trying to say with this spot is totally oposite to the controversial comments people are expressing. The music and rythm are great, as most as Pepsi spots, and Kendal Jenner looks great too. I think if only Kendal would have make the transformation to join the crow as anyone more, it would was enough and more credible to her. However the people who thinks the Kardashians never will know what is living in the real world, makes the choice for a beautiful woman in this spot, lose sense. No matter who people thinks about she or her family, i loved the spot."

My thoughts are, if she really meant to do good with this commercial, then I can understand her spur of the moment response.  It doesn't seem like it was planned, though the shoots and editing looks very well planned. Personally, I think people are over reacting to a situation that could have become a valuable ally to your cause. Think about it like this, I wish there were more prosperous people, celebs and major companies out there that would put themselves on the front lines for the people. Heck I'd buy your product, even a Pepsi. Bold move Kendall, I applaud you for your humanitarian effort. Bravo!"

With that said - Pepsi deserves some credit for beautiful filming - and what seems to be the perception that the demonstrators are completely awesome and cool (and they can dance!)  There's nothing so wrong with the idea that ""we, the people"" who are shouting in the streets to keep our Democracy safe will win in the end (as long as we don't get too fat drinking Pepsi). This ad is obviously not supporting the Trump administration, and it is not more offensive than the holocaust jokes that so many people seem to think are OK these days. It's a lot funnier than holocaust jokes, too."

 Take two seconds to appreciate the fact it was meant to bring people together. Then take the anger you had and use it towards something more useful, perhaps, go outside, continue protesting, not about pepsi, but about the issues you are so passionate about. Calling people names over social media, is not going to bring people together, You're using the same hate that was used to oppress many people of colour/minorities etc, to try and prove your point of being really really offended. Educate people, use compassion. Maybe they will respect and listen to you and what your fighting for."

It isn't a protest against police it isn't a protest for civil rights. It's a peace protest. There's such things as having protest to end wars aka peace protests.

I am a minority, and I know how it feels. You can promote a commercial for peace, for all I care. But, this commercial is misrepresenting the struggle for peace that my ancestors have been through. Martin Luther King did not hand a cop a pepsi for better, he went to jail for better. This commercial is a misinterpretation for the fight for peace!

,262.0,0,2017-04-13T07:21:56Z,"Idk why people are being mean if you just asked an honest question, but anyway...
Basically because Pepsi was trying to capitalize off of the political climate in America these days. There are serious issues being protested here that can't be solved by giving a policeman a Pepsi.
It's patronizing, or attempting to be.
They were hoping to market to the young activists here, but instead it just turned them off.
If a Pepsi, or any drink, could heal the problems in America, I think most of us would buy it. Unfortunately, it's a lot more serious than that.
Hope that makes sense :)"

The commercial is glorifying a protest when, in real life, many protesters are harassed or worse. It wasn't even the commercial itself. It was the mood. Imagine if they made a commercial where they gave terrorists a pepsi and then everyone just started cheering fixing the entire conflict in the Middle East. That is insensitive to the soldiers fighting and the people dying. NO! I am not comparing terrorists to the police. But I am comparing the two conflicts. One is on a larger magnitude, but they are both conflicts nonetheless. I have never participated in a protest before, so I can't understand. This is also probably the reason you don't see the problem. Although it does not affect us directly, it is necessary for us to empathize with those that are affected."

Most offending thing about the ad is that it uses privileged celebrity without touch of common folk reality to portrait her as their representant. Angel comes from heaven to emphasize with oppressed and fight systemic injuistice with the obecity creating commercial product selled by one of the opressors. It is stupidly tasteless and disgusting. Pepsi wanted to become incarnation of ""Body of Christ"", a uniting communion.

It's nonsense, is she a doll or what ? She has a lot of black people in her entourage none of them tell her that the concept was disrespectful ? That's the problem when you don't have any interest on society issues you just play a doll, she could discuss it with pepsi before jumping on the money, she could be more interested on the concept and show people she's not just a superficial top model. It's really deserving black community but also deserve all top model reputation who fight everyday the stereotype of"" pretty face but no brain"". That's what happen when you grow up in a familly who has no idea of what happens in the real world but only act for sex, money, famous and plastic surgery. She work hard to distance herself from all her sisters superficial behavior but I guess educating yourself is clearly not in the Jenner/Kardashian family priority.

That is simply the problem, the fact you DON'T understand why this is wrong in more ways than one. First off stop trying to deflect from something you don't understand by bringing up the war in Syria. We know it's happening and the news people can't report on it because they're always talking about some crazy outrageous thing Trump, the ignorant bastard you voted into office, has said or did. They probably don't report on it because they trust they you all will do it for them because everyone wants to be a news anchor when something they don't feel is important is being reported. 2nd the fact that they tried to make a JOKE out of the black lives matter movement, a cause which people have died and gone to jail for, is repulsive and grossly negligent. People lost their lives in 2016 because of the racial prejudice that still infects America, but racism doesn't exist apparently. Judging by these comments it obviously still exists, and for a society that is supposed to be so progressive and loving/supporting, the reaction is quite actually disappointing.

1524.0,,0,2017-04-06T05:54:04Z,"the only thing that I'm really annoyed about is when these types of ads come out from really popular companies, they use issues like immigration, LGBT, racism, etc to sell their product. And I'm just like: WHY? Pepsi only does one thing: they sell soda and food and stuff. So obviously the ad should be MAINLY about the food or drink or whatever your trying to sell. Using these types of issues in ads has nothing to do with what the corporation is selling. When I think of a company like fritolay or Pepsi I think about how good their products are and I occasionally go and buy said products. I don't care about what their political opinions are. Now I people nowadays want and feel the need speak out about all this stuff, but honestly if your gonna do it in an ad it's gotta be from a corporation or something that actually deals with these types of things or isn't trying to sell something to people. In conclusion the ad didn't make much sense to me, but it doesn't really matter since the Kardashians/Jenners are so fake and worthless that I don't really give a damn...😑"

1556.0,,0,2017-04-06T03:51:26Z,People here are taking this way out of context and nothing visualizing what the actual message is trying to say. This is a clear indication of Propaganda. A company like Pepsi shouldn't be political especially when we are in tough times where people around America are being attacked for having different opinion and views that don't fit the Political Correctness. Also by giving a Pepsi to a Police officer doesn't solve our fucking problem that we currently have with our Society and Police. If that were the case Mexico should give President Trump a can of Pepsi so that he can change his mind on not doing the wall. Jesus Christ people wake up and smell the coffee.

I have  nothing against Kendall I actually do like her , she's really sweet  but she was born rich and knows nothing about the struggle .

I don't understand how Black lives matter got brought into this, I don't understand why we are so offended by a cop accepting a fucking soda from a protester. seriously, get offended by real issues people not bullshit adverts."
,373.0,0,2017-04-12T06:34:39Z,"jenell love The answer is that an ad with realistic protests would not do so good on advert, almost all adverts are dumbed downed scenarios of real life topics ands the trick to to understand it's just an ad and I'm pretty sure BLM riots are not considered protests or at least from the videos I have seen of them."
,374.0,0,2017-04-10T19:45:39Z,"The reason why black people are offended (or black lives matter) is because black people feel as though everything is about them. The audience/viewer has absolutely no idea what the protest is about or what it's for, but black women especially feel they're being replaced by white women. For example, look at how the white woman threw her blonde wig at the black woman. Even if the person who wrote the script didn't mean any harm by it what soever,  black women are going to get triggered by it. 

As a liberal you should know that everyone else protesting and opposing this up-rise is riding the coat tail of the civil rights movement and BLM. All these minorities playing identity politics know they cannot be more oppressed than black people (at least not historically) and in this video, all of the potential minorities are not paying homage. 

Black people obviously do not monopolize protesting, but this video is clearly a mirror of what this rise in protest have been. Useless, mindless, and dumb....Oh yeah, and millennial."

I don't think they were trying to mock the BLM movement or the photo itself. this is a name brand company trying to sell, the last thing they want to do is offend. I still think the people offended by this made it negative instead of seeing the message the ad meant to send."

However, protest aren't  pretty and when people are protesting they are not smiling, Most times in the case of BLM it's to get justice. So when an Ad try and display something so serious and powerful like a protest and make light out of it especially by using someone like Kendall it's sort of insulting.

I'm so sick and tired of seeing comments like Americans are so self centered omg why don't they care about us. Well honey Americans also have problems within their own country.they may not be big but they're are there.and to keep the so called title of being one of the greatest countries,you actually have to be a great country. To do that you focus on the problems within your country. When your country is having problems with homophobes,racists, and Any other people that cause problems you deal with it. But you can't deal with you problems when privileged rich white celebs mock your movement by making commercials thinking a Pepsi will just stop all these problems.  Ex: if you fail a test in class and so does Mary anne. Will you focus on trying to bring up your grade or trying to bring up Mary Anne's.exactly. Mary Anne can't expect you to bring up her grade when you failed too.she'll most likely have to ask someone else. So basically what I'm saying is the U.S can't always be everyone's go to.

Fight with the rebels? Are you kidding? This is a religious was between the Shia and Sunni, ISIS/ISIL is Sunni backed by Saudi Arabia.

I agree it is unrealistic but it's just an ad. People are mad because the ad basically is saying that a can of Pepsi can completely fix all of the problems in the world. We all know it can't. But isn't an ad supposed to show that the product is the best and can fix problems even if it's unrealistic? The point of an ad is to persuade people to buy the product. If an ad was realistic people wouldn't be too interested. So I don't understand why people are making such a huge deal out of this.

,543.0,0,2017-04-07T19:25:38Z,"Wow... you are so far from reality. Let me give you a piece because this year even if it wasn't in the media that much: 31.01.2017 Denver- pastor killed by a muslim, 01.01.2017-Fort Lauderdale- A convert to Islam killed 5 innocents in an airport. Since they were only two these year, means you definetly have no problem eventhough last year you had an attack in which 49 were killed ( in just one attack). On an economical level, since it seems you didn't bother to think that far either, what do you think happens if the countries to whom America has that huge debt, get attacked? Do you not think that they will obligate America to support them? So then it becomes  their problem too. Also, on a strategical level because you know, America actually has some in Europe. America sent military against an aggressive Russia. Are you that childish to think that they will not send military to help the countries with whom they have economical or military treaties if radical muslims start a war? Do you really not know how this world works? Maybe you should read the news more often because there are more pressing problems than a pepsi ad. Also, fyi Christians killed a lot of people and the last one was the Rwanda genocide which was made by Africans in 1994 so..yeah, discussing religion nowadays is not in your favor if you take the race in consideration. If you want to stop racism, stop differentiating because that pasive aggresive atitude and defending to the point of seeing no issue  is not only dislikeable but also unrealistic. By the way, you can't manipulate words and say that only because black people represent a smaller number in the comunity, means that the number of them getting killed is higher. The percentage is higher but the number of them killed is not higher than the number of white people getting killed by the cops. Percentage is a totally different thing than the actual number. Don't try to manipulate it in your favor to make a point because people are not that stupid."

,557.0,0,2017-04-06T02:08:36Z,"What your saying literally does not make any sense. There is a saying, the oppressed cannot oppress. The amount of times I have saw a white person generalize and say ""they"" just in this thread alone is sickening. It's insane how offended a white person can be from calling them out on their color, your white. Acknowledge that stating this is not for it to be a racial slur, but to address. Unlike the countless WHITE people in this thread who have used they, meaning it for it to be hurtful. Clearly many of you ignore your white privilege other wise you would see how people would find this offensive. People in the media like to only show riots of black people and immediately that is how everyone in the US will now see a BLM peaceful movement. I was offended when a young white woman comes to save the day by giving a white police officer something to drink, by doing this she has brought together the police and the citizens. How is that not offensive? I understand that some of you who do not deal with discrimination and prejudice by your color cannot understand this, but DO NOT try to down play someone's feelings simply because you do not understand them."
,558.0,0,2017-04-06T01:56:11Z,"Syenna Williams first of all if you did care about the whole problem, you wouldn't differentiate in the first place. your information ia based on what? pull out official statistics not just words. the ones i said , were from an article in washingtonpost that actually debated that problem. right...you know the definition of white doesn't limit itself only to American caucasians so basically it's bs to say that. Also racism means by definition to differentiate based on race which you did so that makes you...racist. "

,562.0,0,2017-04-06T00:59:59Z,"Syenna Williams The problem when you say ""whites"" is that you're also refering to countries whose ancestors had nothing to do with slavery towards you. When you say whites, you generalize so basically you're promoting racism yourself. Good job there! i don't get why you act all high and mighty when white slavery existed also. White slavery existed in the Muslim countries in the 19th century and even in North Africa in the 1500-1800. Do you see us acting all opressed about what your ancestors did? No! Progression doesn't mean being stuck in the past but moving forward. Statistics in your country show that there are actually more white people shot by the police but somehow nobody is making a fuss about it? Why don't you fuss about that too? Sorry, but that is racist and discriminating based on race because if you actually cared about police brutality, you'd defend all the people shot not only the ones of the race that you favor. As much as you say that we are the problem, you're also contributing to it. We're not the ones insensitive here but you are because you're differentiating based on race on problems where everyone should be united in solving them."

109.0,,0,2021-06-19T21:56:27Z,"The message is out of touch because the simple, pleasant scenario depicted in the ad doesn't exist, at least not in the public imagination. In this advertisement, there are two groups: law enforcement, and protesters. They are shown to be physically as well as psychologically divided, but by what catalyst? It almost seems like a celebration and not a march/protest because of the music in the background, the lack of provocative messages on signs, and the reasonably happy looking people (who are all young and good looking). The marketers wanted to depict the Pepsi brand as being a symbol of unity and peace. They constructed an oversimplified scenario to swoop in and save the day.

But the public was not fooled because the conflict depicted does not exist in reality. In the current era, we are not concerned with a tidy mass of peaceful protesters that form a neat line in front of a row of police officers and do not destroy the streetfronts around them. We are concerned with the mobs. They are not good-looking people with neat hair and soft expressions holding positive signs for their cause. Instead, they have backpacks and full facemasks, holding signs with provocative threats. They throw rocks and there is yelling and chaos all around. The police are on edge, and there are bright flashing lights and sirens from police cars. There's no music playing in the background, but instead there is a drive for self-preservation amid anarchic chaos directed towards the closest adversary. 

A peace offering cannot be made between these groups. One exists to quell the other, and one exists to create chaos and noise. They are fundamentally opposed groups, unlike in the fairytale land in the ad. It was controversial because people understand that it is false inherently. They don't need to type a short essay like I did to know why it is out of touch and exploitative of the current political landscape. 

It's like when the ""great French princess"" (commonly thought to be Marie Antoinette, but likely this is apocryphy) said ""let them eat cake."" There is no cake to be eaten by the masses. And even if there was, it's not the plight of the masses that they are hungry, but WHY they are hungry. Pepsi would be totally good if this was indeed an accurate representation of things. But it's not. It just shows their ignorance."

Jealousy comes to mind with the individuals that were participants in the tweeting wanting receive attention they richly deserve. Perhaps the intent was to boycott Pepsi. Well folks you lost.

The attempt to link it to the photo of Iesha Evans specifically is also tenuous -- it's far more reminiscent of the ""flower power"" protests from the Vietnam War era.

295.0,,0,2020-05-01T21:53:19Z,"I was watching kuwtk and this commercial came up. I remembered it but never really watched it but after watching this video I understand the problem. People were mad because there was a protest against police acting violently towards people of colour ( mostly black) and then a white women randomly walks pass everyone (doesnt even know what theyre protesting agianst) and hands off a drink then the problem is resolved. Not only is this ad stupid but poorly casted. And for people saying ""If it was Beyonce or Rihanna it wouldn't be a problem"" no it wouldn't because they are people of colour and do things for the community."
296.0,,9,2020-04-22T22:04:03Z,"I think this is the problem with the ad: Many people were mad about it because it exemplified a protest, that looks nothing like most that happen around the world. Obviously Pepsi did not want to show an extremely violent protest to advertise their product, but the harsh reality is that most protests are met with brutal forces. Additionally, the fact that Kendall Jenner just walked in and “saved the day” aggravated people as well. She was just taking apart in a photo shoot when a nearby protest was happening, and the she became intrigued. It essentially shows that she had no intention of doing anything to fight for whatever issue was being protested for, until she saw that it was happening. It seems to be a parallel to some celebrities who are so caught up in their own world that they only join in on mainstream issues (not saying anything about Kendall Jenner here, they just used her as a symbol of fame.) I also think people are mad because this celebrity just walks up and stops the potential police forces by doing absolutely nothing, when these protestors presumably have been fighting for this issue for a long time. It made people feel like their issues aren’t going to be heard or responded to because they are not popular, rich, or famous."

I honestly don't see the big deal. All this ad can be accused of being is naive and nothing else. I honestly think all this hype is because of Kendall

496.0,,0,2018-06-30T21:20:23Z,I think that this commercial was just fine and done with a lighthearted approach to a really big problem with this country. Now as for the Kendall Jenner subject I have a great deal of issues with this. They should have gotten Rhianna or Beyonce to do this commercial. She is not the star that it takes to be in a Pepsi ad. Come on now look at all the previous star's they've used. She doesn't have what it takes to be in one. I'm so sick of these Kardashian's thinking that they are movie stars. All they are are reality TV stars. I'm sorry but I just can't stand them. Enough is enough girls.
497.0,,0,2018-06-30T20:18:18Z,The ad is 100% ok. America just has too many overt sensitive and critical people who turn everything into controversy. It's a disease. More power to you Kendall

502.0,,0,2018-06-23T16:24:51Z,"Its kind of sad that this commercial was meant to be about unity. Are people saying because Kendal is white, and wealthy that she isnt allowed to be outraged by police brutality? Or that as a white wealthy women she isnt allowed to support a group? 
You DO know a lot of charieties go to rich people && try to get them on board with causes in order to get DONATIONS for a cause? Or do you want to pretend the money is coming from the poor (not that they cant donate). 
People stand there and hate on rich people (of any color), but dont realize these rich people are funding your cause.... because they care about the cause. Not all, but a lot do. 
But i find it very fuckin ignorant to have a group that is suppose to stand for and  asks forTOLERANCE, unity, peace, love, and not to be JUDGED by the COLOR OF ONES SKIN. Yet all im seeing is a lot of people judging this ad because its a white female that is wealthy. Because that should REALLY matter... right 🙄😒. If you really want to bring awareness to your movement, maybe you shouldnt shut down those who are trying to help bring awareness to it. Even though i didnt care for the commercial... but its also just that.., a fuckin commercial. We all know red bull wont give you wings, and that your cheese cant talk or turn into a superhero (as it leaps into your kids lunch box), and we also know that Pepsi cant end a protest. But its a commercial. But sharing anything, a drink, a snack, a hug, a story,.. etc can cause someone to smile and ease up a little in such situations. Not always... but to assume it cant... means to assume and to generalize a group (in this case- the police). 
I dunno people. I think you all need to get off your high horses and stop thinking everything is a negative rather then a positive."

The idea that Pepsi would do this for malicious purposes is insane , so the worst Ill put against them is  ignorance. Fighting against them for it would only more harm though a waste of time.

591.0,,0,2018-03-28T19:33:46Z,In my opinion it wasn’t offensive I think people are overreacting. People give Kendall a lot of hate but people think she is the one who writes the script for her role in the commercial. She only has to act out her part. If people are so offended stop targeting Kendall and tell that to Pepsi. And I’m pretty sure Pepsi was trying to show a worldwide message of peace and unity but they didn’t do it the right way obviously. I think the Pepsi commercial was just sort of dumb not offensive. Kendall didn’t do anything wrong she was just doing her assigned role and if she would have seen this coming she wouldn’t have done it

And in the ads,  Kendall was seen handing out a can of Pepsi to one of the police,  which can be considered as a sign of hospitality.  And some people don't see that as insensitive.

And now these professional protesters are protesting about the Pepsi commercial.  Too classic!  (Oh, wait, that's Coke!)  And it's so clear why these protesters would do that!  BECAUSE THEY'RE PROFESSIONAL PROTESTERS!  This is what they do!  Doesn't matter what it is, it must somehow be offensive.  The other side objects to this garbage ad on the grounds of artistic integrity.  What happened to realism?  Where are the overturned cop cars being burned?  The smashed windows?  The ""What do we want?  DEAD COPS!  When do we want 'em? NOW!"" chants! Yeah, brave, noble, smiling, happy,, music-playing rioters!  Sure, that's realism!  Hilarious!  The right loves this ridiculous example of the ridiculous far left making themselves ridiculous as usual.  So not everyone hates this ad."

It shows again why the political movement ""Black Lives Matter"" is so god damn divisive and self-absorbed.

708.0,,0,2017-11-24T22:31:23Z,"Twitter is a horrible indicator of public opinion. Too many emotionally invested folks.
Pepsi has been running these kinds of ads forever, IMO it was because protest is viewed more negatively than before with the well known activist groups of today being extremely violent. Protest, on both the conservative and progressive sides, has been vindicated as mobs of angry, indoctrinated zombies. 
So Pepsi releases this ad expecting that a celebrity drop and some POCs would expend their revenue. Unfortunately, the Right is reminded of BLM while scoffing at the tokens. Meanwhile the Left draws parallels with some specific image that nobody knows about except them. Yeah, the ad is a co-op, but when was it not a co-op? 
What is odd is that the ad was definitely for the younger members of the political Left, and that ignoring any possibility of backlash from the Right was foolish. But despite all the heavy handed servicing to the Left, Pepsi failed to engage the target audience, or any audience."

732.0,,2,2017-10-30T19:08:55Z,"I am doing a paper on this ad for my marketing /advertising class in college. This commercial was actually very well thought out and has a beautiful message. I don't even know where to begin. All of the signs say things like unity, peace, love, or have symbols such as hearts and peace signs...and there's even a sign that says ""join the conversation"" At 2:39 there are signs hanging from the buildings that have many languages on them  LEBE in German is LIVE , PAG IBIB in Filipino is LOVE. The song that is being played is by Bob Marley's grandson Skip Marley and som of the song is lions the lyrics are:
Some said 'never' but the never done come
Yeah, and took our trust
Hate's been winning, but the lovers ain't done
Yeah, not on my watch
Yeah, if ya took all my rights away
Yeah, if ya tellin' me how to pray
Yeah, if ya won't let us demonstrate
Yeah, wrong
Yeah, if ya thinking I don't belong
Yeah, if ya hiding behind a gun
Yeah, if ya hoping we're gonna run
Wrong
We are the lions, we are the chosen
We gonna shine out the dark
We are the movement, this generation
You better know who we are, who we are
Yeah, if…

you also notice in the commercial that there are many races and cultures and religions, but they are all joining together and walking and many are playing music or carrying instruments...music is the universal language. Also "" join the conversation"" is a twofold thing for one it means we should be talking about peace and harmony and love for all cultures, religions, and races and on the other hand there is a book called Join the Conversation: How to Engage Marketing-Weary Consumers with the Power of Community, Dialogue, and Partnership and they could be making reference to that also..Finally, this is NOT A PROTEST..this is a demonstration. There are never ever any demonstrations that don't have police officers there to just make sure things go ok. People are trying to compare Kendall giving the pepsi to an officer to a moment when a protestor got arrested Ieshia L. Evans, but they just don't compare. It's absurd! The demonstration in the pepsi commercial is not  racially charged, the only agenda is to support world peace and harmony, the cops are not in riot gear and their stance is relaxed and at ease. This has aboslutely nothing to do with police brutality or BLM. I just think that Pepsi was trying to convey a message, and because of all of the hate we can't even hear a message about peace and unity. Police brutality is very very wrong, but that's not what this commercial is about. It's sad because the removal of this commercial and backlash that it  recieved shows what a sad state our nation is in. More hate won't eradicate hate."

Y'all niggas aint the first to take an issue to the streets - and y'all ain't gonna be the last. So when somebody takes that blueprint - it does not have anything to do with you so GTFOH!!!! The occupy movement, green peace, gay pride, pro choice  - all regular protesters. Could you even call it a protest??? It was more of a parade. Protests are AGAINST something, as the name suggests. But they were marching FOR love and tolerance and EVERYBODY WAS FUCKING SMILING! I mean really what more do people want?  Even the part where Kendall gives the guy a Pepsi: isn't there an old Michael Jackson video where a little girl gives a soldier a flower. That image of a protester or civilian facing up to a cop or soldier with a bold act of love has been played out in history for decades. There are dozens of historic images with similar scenarios.

Always in a top place like a house with a huge pool and nice cars, everybody looking nice wearing nice clothing and seemingly having the fun of their lives. Because beer makes you handsome and a chick magnet and truly brings true happiness!

Which is to say: quite stupid ads lol.

At least in the beer ads there is ***some*** justification: once you're drunk enough, typically your overall judgment capacity goes way down, so much so that members of the opposite sex might seem much less ugly and much more attractive than they really would seem to you if you had remained sober (and this typically works on both males and females, too). The ads just make it seem like the evening of extreme drinking debauchery is a promise that it will end with hot sex. Not with, much more classically and more typically, hours spent kneeling and throwing up in some toilet bowl."

But just because in America we have electricity, “clean” water, and $0.79 generic Mac N Cheese, doesn’t mean there aren’t actual problems. Please tell me how someone making $10, 40 hours a week, 52 weeks, is supposed to support themselves and somehow better their future by going to tech school or college while living on $20,800 before any taxes. $20,800 is fuck all to get by on here in Green Bay WI, let alone big cities, and coastal cities. Unless you have a family that can somehow support you, you get completely stuck. I come from a poor family but luckily I wasn’t booted out of the house after high school and am able to live at home while going to college, so I don’t have housing costs, food costs (unless I eat out), and all the other little stuff. I can blatantly see how easily I could get stuck if I didn’t have a supportive family. And this is all best case scenario that you’re fresh out of high school, healthy, and have no other commitments. Now imagine having a kid, or having cancer, or being 40 where you’re likely completely on your own with little support from anyone unless you have a significant other. We’re not in the days of our parents and our grandparents and our great grandparents. There are very few jobs that you can go from high school to work and be able to support yourself and potentially a family. Back in my grandparents’ day you could come fresh out of high school, hell even just have an 8th grade education and as long as you were old enough you could get a job at some manufacturing plant and support a stay at home mom and kids all on your own. Now if you want to do that you either have to strike gold and get a union manufacturing job that only requires a high school diploma, or you have to get higher education, which isn’t free, and if you’re already broke with no credit, how are you supposed to pay for it. FAFSA helps but it certainly doesn’t cover the majority of the costs of any university, not even most tech schools. If back when we needed kids to stay in high school to get better skills for work which we then provided for free, why shouldn’t we do the same now with college as the economy changes.

Gonna stop here as I’m just ranting at this point. But people somehow miss the fact that it’s not 1960 anymore with a super strong manufacturing economy. We can’t just say “oh our grandparents ‘worked hard’ and were fine so why change anything, fuckin lazy millennials.”"

Again, I never said you can't disagree, you can, but you did it in a way that clearly showed you were trying to dismiss their point, instead of, like others, considering their point and then disagree. 

If, we as a community want to move, we need to stop this ""sharing opinions = false appeal to authority/whitewashed/seeking white validation"" because it paints us as monolithic which reinforces racists thoughts and encourages generalizing and stereotyping. 

Like I said, check how the top replies are conversing, that's how debating works, not ""you telling your opinion, which offended me, is you trying to speak for all of us"" 

Your reason to disagree is valid however you did not say that in og comment. If you were truly disturbed, you would have mentioned it as your opposing argument. It looks like you read the first sentence then started typing 

If you felt like that was a false appeal to authority then that's on you. It kind of seems like you're intimidated by individuality but whatever. 

You have the right to share your opinion, just don't dismiss their whole point."

However, I'm just pointing out the whole ""I'm black and I'm not offended by [what other black people find racist]"" spiel is a false appeal to authority and I genuinely think it's troubling because it can possibly reinforce racist thoughts and biases. And I wanted to make that disagreement with OP known. This is a PUBLIC forum. The OP came and shared their thoughts and worldview. I disagreed and stated where I'm coming from. We don't have to agree with each other. But we can all take and learn something form each other in this space. The OP can't control how I react to their comment. The same way you can't control how you reacted to my initial comment. It is what it is."

I've spent my life trying to be the best person I can be because I always grw up thinking that white people expected me to fail. I shouldn't have had to do that I know. But in the 1970s' ethnic people in th U.K. had a reputation for ""getting into trouble"" which was magnified by people's prejudices. Hence I always felt I had to be better than ""white"". So I made sure I did everything opposite to what ""black"" people were accused of doing. Generally just being a respectful, hard-working individual. I've been stopped by the police on numerous occasions for good reason and otherwise. I never gave any of them cause to treat me different to anyone else. And I've found that because of that they treated me with the same respect. I truly understand that racial abouse hasn't gone anywhere and people are still suffering, but when folk try to call it out using people who are far from upstanding citizens you're actually just adding to the fire instead of making the situation better."

People will protest about that arrest and the stationary cycle continues. People are reluctant to change. So the cycle won't change. That's why I don't care if a man gets beaten.

Also it wasn't only her that recieved hate and backlash it was also pepsi themselves and also kendal may have ""just acted"" but she knew ahead of time what she was portraying she signed a contract to be in that ad she agreed to be in it so all of what you just said is wrong isn't it."

What I mean is she should have known on her own, the way she’s talking it sounds like she’s saying oh everyone else thinks it’s wrong so it must be wrong. But she should of understood herself that it was wrong. Because if that’s true than she really doesn’t understand why what she did was wrong. She’s just conforming to public opinion. It’s kind of like her saying well personally I don’t get why it’s a big deal, but everyone else is miffed so I’ll be miffed too. Does this make any sense?"

This type of ad (handing a softdrink to a person for a better day  or even  world peace) is overdone for decades.

Honestly, I think people cant just ignore commercials anymore, they feel entitled to say their opinion and act as if being offended is a trend."

,93.0,0,2017-10-26T20:18:04Z,"I disagree. And that point you just mentioned is the reason why no one that was offended by the ad has any empathy for Kendall. ""She knew what she was getting herself into"" as if it was super obvious to see. Look, the way I see it is: the commercial has a really controversial topic. And only a certain percentage of people were offended by it. To those offended it was clear why it was offensive, but to some that weren't offended, it honestly just looks like a regular commercial. Seriously, it was just disrespectful. To a girl who has lived her life in luxury, without ever being directly affected by these controversial problem, its not that obvious as someone who has to live it every single day."

Soy de Mexico pero Naci en Los Estados Unidos y en mi juventud vivi en Mexico. Tambien tengo familia en Francia. So don't make THAT an excuse for your shitty grammar. But that's irrelevant and besides the point. Im not making excuses for the Jenner/Kardashian family. I'm just saying the facts, and even though it might seem like they can do whatever they want, they don't have a say in half of the shit they have to do (an example this ad) because they are under contracts that restrict what they can or can't say and do. The same thing happens when an actor acts in a movie. They cant speak about the movie UNTIL it comes out. They cant defend the movie if it gets bad reviews because if they say the wrong thing it could mean more bad than good. Even scandals are faked here in LA all the time. Its part of this business, its the way people in the spotlight make money, by staying relevant. DRAMA makes you relevant to the crowd, because people just LOVE drama and reality T.V. They didn't just become famous from their pretty faces. That is never enough, you need to be either a genius at marketing yourself, or hire a genius to market your image and manage how your life seems to the public eye. I WOULD judge Kendall if she did something fucked up. But all the reasons that people hate the Kardashians (because of scandals, drama) are stupid reasons because they literally don't affect me or the world in anyway. If you think they are fake bitches, its because they only show the public eye what they want the public eye to see. Its not that difficult to understand if you see it as what it is: A BUSINESS."
,98.0,0,2017-10-31T23:50:30Z,"It's funny you don't want to judge Kendall for doing this crazy add but have no shame to judge ME with my ""grammar"".

So excume me to mess up the english grammar But before judging , try to learn at least 1 other language and you'il see it's not easy to do 0 faults. And one more time, i would never ever find excuses for Kendall and her whole fam, they are all fake bitches who keep doing crazy stupid things (the tee shirts with legends, the pepsi add, ...) for fame, money, attention, status,.. Call it as you want."
,99.0,0,2017-10-30T18:12:18Z,"okay, so it clearly shows you have no idea how the show industry works, and no idea how to use grammar. First off, I think you are confusing the want for attention with money. Celebrities might seem like they want attention, but they actually are looking for whatever opportunity they can find to make more money. Second, you do realize she has no say in the matter, the way she had no say in how the commercial was written. All she was suppose to do is act as they told her. Celebrities are under contract, they cant always choose when or what to say because they could get sued by the companies affected. You really think the company Pepsi was going to let her apologize whenever she wanted? Running the risk of her saying something out of line and making it worst for Pepsi? Of course not! They probably forced her to not say anything, told her to wait and let the scandal calm down, and then they set her up on Keeping up with the Kardashians where they could monitor what she was going to say and edit it however they pleased. Plus, why should the model apologize but not the company PEPSI? Get over yourself"
,100.0,0,2017-10-28T19:36:12Z,She wanted to Be a part of the movement and gain attention for it. She didn't think ppl were gonna réact like that cuz she didnt even think about the fact that it can offend ppl. She Just wanted attention and is Willing to do everything to have it. She didnt care about the culture. They asked her to apology for it and she didnt. She waited to do it on her keeping up with the Kardash show only for the program to gain views. If she really felt sorry she would have done it way before this fuckin episode on the show. And dont Forget several journalists got fired because of her cuz she didnt want to answer questions about this fuckin pepsi drama.

597.0,,0,2017-10-20T18:33:11Z,"Ok I have to say something, I can’t stand this anymore. Now before anyone says I’m ignorant and stuff, I’d just want you to know that I’m all about equality and the end to all racism, sexism, homophobia and all that shit because this kind of hate in the world is absolutely not needed. But you know what kind of hate is unnecessary? The hate of all these people making fun and bashing celebs when all their doing is their job. You want to get upset with the ad? Then get upset with it. Kendall didn’t write the script. She didn’t direct it. All she did was act in it like everyone else in the ad. What aren’t people bashing the other people who were in the ad? Oh because they aren’t famous, and therefore nothing’s really to be said about them. But the ad too, it’s JUST an ad. If all of you take these ads so seriously then what has the world come to. At least they showed how racism was going on in the world. They just didn’t show the correct way to FIX it. But what do you expect? It’s an ad for a SOFT DRINK for goodness sake, y’all are just too sensitive to handle an ad that DIDNT find a good SOLUTION for fixing RACISM for a SOFT DRINK company and y’all are blaming it on Kendall?? Like?? I completely understand how she feels. She thought it was a big breakout. A chance to shine in her career but you guys pulled her down and laughed at her face. She didn’t know exactly what she was doing wrong and it maybe because she didn’t really think about it that much. Everyone just hates the Kardashians because they’re overhyped and stuff and yes, they are, but they’re just celebrities. Why do you hate people you’ve never met? People always preach about loving one another and ending all hate but y’all are hypocrites. Say they’re not talented, say they’re divas, idk about you but I have watched some of the episodes and they’re just obviously trying to entertain the viewers. They haven’t done anything shitty to the world like Trump did so why are y’all hating?? They have their careers, you have your life. And I bet all of you have something more productive to do than to hate on celebrities because I don’t hate people I’ve never met who haven’t seemed to have done anything wrong. Truth is, people are way too sensitive nowadays on things that aren’t even that big of a deal. Was the ad racist? No. It was just kind of stupid but still, it’s a soft drink ad you see. Idk but the internet likes to choose celebs to hate nowadays and everyone just hops onto that bandwagon without ever knowing why they’re hating. Maybe the Kardashians got it better than us, okay, but so what? They’re happy, if you’re upset then you’re obviously unhappy about your own life. They’re success does not affect yours or anyone’s life whatsoever. People say ‘there are people out there suffering and all the media does is focus on these divas’ but trust me when I say that these divas have done more to help those people than you ever have. They’ve donated millions, visited them, started campaigns. What have you done? Apart from hating on them all day. It doesn’t matter if another famous celebrity comes along. If you like them, it’s good. But if you don’t, it’s literally none of your business. They aren’t out here for your opinion. The world would be a better place without all the hate, and I mean ALL the hate. It’s unnecessary and revolting. Treat people with kindness. Show love, choose love. That’s al I have to say. I’m sorry if it’s too long but I believe in you and I believe everyone should be given a chance to shine in this world. Choose love."

666.0,,0,2017-10-10T23:11:18Z,Yes. Kendall agreed to do a stupid thing but I don't think she she was thinking about the outcome of that. She didn't see anything wrong with what she was getting herself into. It's not like she did this on purpose to piss people off. She made a mistake and she's learning from it. We all make mistakes. Hers is just made more public and that's why she's getting all this hate.

It doesn't mean that Pepsi is going to fix our country and a sip of a pepsi will end our division. It just means that even people that are so far divided can agree that they like Pepsi. Still it was probably a good idea to remove it because so many people got butt hurt but I don't see the big deal."

And even if she did realise the ad was bad and would ruin her career.....do u really think she wouldnt be sorry? This includes all world problems in tht add. I get she seems rich and snobby and sassy but we all have our bad times. (like u r having right now cuz ur being insanley careless and rude without even thinking) But she is still human. And not being sorry for making everyone feel bad. AND making millions of people hate you allll just for one tiny paycheck (its tiny to her cuz shes rich) Is the dumbest thing ive ever heard. Before u go on to say she was faking dude u have to seriously ask yourself why she would be faking. Cuz what u just said makes no sense whatsover. That opportunity for her was a lose-lose chance. The Most she could do was be sorry about it. YOU REALLY NEED TO THINKKK

You’re wasting your time honestly. Me, Serena, and Lilly have social lives unlike you. We have things to do in day-to-day life. You don’t because all you do is leave 10 year old name calling comments. Just shut the hell up already. You sound very immature, you’re trying to show your all that when you’re not. Like what Lilly said, you should be thankful you don’t live in America. Trust me, coming from someone who lives there, one little thing you do makes people think you’re a racist or you get sued. Take the confederate statues for example. People even get offended by that being shown to the public. It’s a part of history, you can’t change the past. If you want to keep fighting with me, then go ahead. I might just leave you to your own device sooner or later.

How about you ignore US all together? But no, your pride is too big and you MUST feel like you have the final word. You know what lets do this. This is my last reply, whatever you say after I will just ignore, report, and block you, because honestly sweetie, I feel like I'm making a mistake by wasting my time on you. I'm trying to put sense into you, and you clearly don't have a clue what to fight about anymore, all you want to do is feel like a big bad mean girl who bashes people but the truth is, you are just making a fool of yourself. So as I was saying, you can reply after me if you want to, but just know no one (or at least me) will be answering. I will let you stay here in this comment section all alone arguing with yourself, which is probably how you live your real life, feeling alone and miserable, and full of hate. Bye bye bitch, how about you go suck some dick for a living, follow in on your mother's footsteps ;) and leave us alone. Imma go live my wonderful blessed life, and you will just be an entertaining toy for me, my little puppet I got to ruffle up and play with. But I get bored of my toys easily, specially when your comebacks are so repetitive and boring. Anyways, bye doughnuts, and Serena. A pleasure to meet both of you, a disappointment I had to meet a pile of dog shit along the way too, but oh well. We had our fun :D Bye girls!"

I'm a black engineering major in College and the only time I get to catch up on news events is when I'm back home (I was not offended by the pepsi ad) I don't have time to search up news events, neither do I have newspaper subscriptions or a TV. I don't blame them for not knowing what was going on. I barely have time to do that either. But we can't deny that ads exaggerate everything! Perfume makes you sexier, x makes you confident and y makes you happy and detergent turns your sheets into clouds, so of course it is unrealistic for a can of pepsi to end a riot, but its no different to the numerous exaggerations and lies that are present in advertising."

 Nearly all the Black people killed by police were violent offenders. The only ones that anger me are Tamir Rice and Treyvon martin. Blm is wrong because it makes it race issue instead of what it actually is, a Class warefare issue. White people are not killing black people at obscene rates, its the opposite.

Something she had NEVER experienced. She had been basically given everything and never had to fight for her rights. It's just a slap in the face to the minorities who struggle with social injustice every single day. It's disrespectful to those who protested for Black Lives Matter.. knowing how many young black men are KILLED & not receiving the justice that they deserve. It's Pepsi's fault for doing this and it's her fault for getting involved in something she knows nothing about. You can't just handle a fragile situation by hand a police officer a can of soda. Wtf.

,508.0,0,2017-12-04T03:01:56Z,"Fajr Williams K I’m not a part of this argument but I can’t help but say something. WOW, if anyone’s “close minded”, it’s you. You just made assumptions and generalizations over Chinese and white people. When did he say that China is the whole world? When did he say that the only culture that matters is his? Why did you say “Chinese seem so stuck up”, when it’s only ONE persom from an ENTIRE culture? He simply said how it’s perfectly fine for another culture-white, black, etc- to adopt from his culture as long as there’s no downgrading. He used himself as an example as to why “cultural appropriation” is a dumb idea considering America is a melting pot. And “White people have a history of theft, deception, lying... that’s what they’re known for.” NEWSFLASH: The human race sucks and sadly that’s seen EVERYWHERE, not only white people. You think only white people are liars and pedophiles? By that logic, other cultures and races are perfect and have no flaws. OFC, not all of them are, but sadly messed up people exist of all colours...

I personally agree with him, because getting offended over “cultural appropriation” would mean me getting offended over non-latinos eating tacos, pupusas, etc. (I’m latina)"
,509.0,0,2017-12-04T02:54:41Z,"Fajr Williams you just proved how racist you are again. White people arent responsible for the sins of their ancestors. You think black peoples are innocent? Please. You’re pathetic, hip hop is a trend. Nothing more. I’m not saying it’s bad, in fact I quite like it, however it’s only been around for thirty years, a culture is something that stands the test of time, hip hop won’t be popular in 5-10 years. It’s gonna go the same way that jazz and rock did. And Chinese culture is one of the oldest on the face of the earth, so excuse me for having higher standards. “Why are Chinese people so stuck up?” Really? “Why are black people so stupid?”, what you just said is the literal equivalent to that. WAnd I said blonde or red STRAIGHT HAIR. You don’t look like you have straight hair to me. All music forms were created by black people? The base of American music forms maybe, but not anything else. Where did I say that because something wasn’t my culture it isn’t culture, are you retarded? European culture, African culture, there are a lot of fucking cultures out there, not just Chinese, where did I say that? Nothing you said was racist? Jesus you’re stupid, white people arent a monolith. Africans also have a history of enslaving, raping, and killing, every culture on this earth has. Ever heard of the mongol empire? Barbary slave trade? Grow the fuck up sweetheart. you’re probably the most ignorant person I’ve encountered on this site. It’s clear to me that this is just gonna be a back and forth of you spewing your racist bullshit so I’m not gonna bother responding, I’m blocking you. Feel free to waste your time angrily writing a response, I won’t even see it. Bye hun."

Why is Kendall only getting hate when there was many more actors in the commercial? The fact that they even shes light on this (non existent) problem doesn't make people happy? My god.

Education cures stupid, AWARENESS cures stupid. But you don't seem that well educated yourself, so Im not surprised by your response. If you really wanted to have people agree with you then you would actually explain why the ad is SOOOOOOO HURTFUL to you. People who don't understand why the ad is hurtful aren't stupid, they are just not affected by it the way you are. We don't live the same lives, none of us do, so we all have different views and opinions on this matter. If you really wanted to make a change you would spread awareness of the issue instead of just sitting on your ass and complaining on a random YouTube video. You would be proactive about the situation. I feel like just like any other world issue, everyone is entitled to be or not be offended by this. You cant try to force people to be mad by the ad if their lives literally aren't affected at all by this matter. Some people have better things to do. Im not defending her, Im just saying, Im not as butt hurt about it as you are."

She read the script, if she was ignorant enought to NOT know how fucked the whole ad is, how can you blame her - you cant cure stupid. Doing it for the $$$, not caring who you hurt along the way is just.. Cant even find a word for it. If you all dont see why the ad is wrong, well youve proven you cant cure stupid."

,600.0,0,2017-10-06T05:50:20Z,"Well technically she didn't apologize, and she doesnt need to, she didnt write the script, she didnt make the ad, she was just an actor like the people in the crowd and the people who played the cops, they were there for the same reason and yet they didnt need to apologize? Stop holding celebrities to expectations you wouldnt hold for regular people. All she did was cry, which is what any normal human being would do,  cry, she was frustrated and regretting the whole thing that she cried, and honestly thats probably how she went to sleep the days following the ad and the backlash. She said it, she felt stupid for doing it, atleast she admitted she only did it for the exposure and didnt actually consider the ads overall message."

Why are you threatening people and insulting people like its going to do any good. All we ever wanted was good. Thats possibly what she wanted. We cant solve police abuse with a can of soda.

They were just showing people protesting peacefully, understand each other and share.

,801.0,0,2017-10-10T21:20:35Z,Sabrina Williams Little things they do...okay because plagarism is such a little thing that we should all ignore it...until it happens to ourselves. The only reason why I know about the Kardashian Klan is because of Porn Hub LOOL
,802.0,0,2017-10-10T21:19:01Z,"Sabrina Williams Maybe because it was the only question/reply I saw of yours at the time? Ever thought of that?

The Camo bikini suits look INCREDIBLY similar and they could be easily mistaken for eachothers. Kylie should have added her own touch. Another example (Further arguemebts against this) is Rihanna's Fenty Puma slides and how Kim Kardashian's slides (Literally just beige, nothing else really) look really similar to Rihannas. On the other hand, fur slides have become really popular and they all look the same so Kim has an excuse and Rihanna didn't even fur slides so that's another excuse BUT she still could have added her own touch"

,804.0,0,2017-10-10T19:50:24Z,"m e l a n i n right and I asked a lot of other questions but you into seem to see one. I wonder why? Maybe because you don't like her. Also, if I see a celebrity and I like what they are wearing, I would probably try to copy as well but because it is Kylie Jenner, people have a problem. Also, it's called inspiration. She liked something and she tried to create it but better and she did pretty well. Like the Shannon palette, yes they look similar but maybe  she wanted something simple and her eyeshadows were much better than Shannon's so............."
,805.0,0,2017-10-10T19:42:46Z,"m e l a n i n wait a minute, so you do have a problem with the karadshians and the jenners, this is not about the ad, this is about your personal self esteem issues. Thanks for clearing that up. I was wondering why people were hating the ad and now you have cleared that up for me but I have a advice for you, stop hating on girls who are obviously doing better than you and grow up. Pathetic"

She also (with Kendall) printed photos of famous music legends such as Biggie Smalls and TuPac on to t shirts (  http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/notorious-bigs-mom-slams-kendall-kylie-jenners-t-shirts-w490456 ) and printed their OWN faces over them sith NO permission whatsoever. Even worse? If you are un familiar with Hip Hop, Tupac and his mother are dead so she is not here to defend her son so Biggie Small's mother (Alive but her son is dead) had to defend her son, Tupac and Tupac's MOTHER.

Oh wait theres more. Kendall only said sorry (through a tweet) when they were all sold out.

Who cares about if they are a Jenner or a Kardashian. They're featured on KUWTKARDASHIANS and they're (Kylie and Kendall) in the little Kardashian Clique.

Maybe YOU should grow up and educate yourself."

Be as neutral as possible and just report, a little flare is nice. Watch E! News if you need further pointers. Probably why the best you could do was a shitty YouTube channel. Eh, only people as dumb as the people who work for you, subscribe."

But that was she who made a choice to perticipate in that add with this context and if she didn't see anything wrong with it, it means that she was so self-absorbed with her anticipation of the future success and possibility to stand up in the same row with Michael Jackson and other huge celebs, so she was fine with the provided context of that add. It just shows what a personality she has. She is definitely able to think ONLY about HER benefits and won't' care of anything else till it bites her butt!!!"
