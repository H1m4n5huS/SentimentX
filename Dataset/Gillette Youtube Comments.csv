Gillettes commercials is unprecedented in that respect. After all a normal company wants something from the customer not vice versa. What Gillette does is if not insulting than at least alienating.

And God knows we all want the companies that have similar ideas and values to support the campaigns to win come the time to vote. In a nut shell follow the money and spend wisely my friend.

The issue with this ad is that it further entrenches the cultural narrative that men are the root of all evil.  2/3rds of women say they feel bullied by their female coworkers, yet this ad portrays bullying as masculine behavior.

,79.0,0,2022-03-19T18:13:25Z,"‚Äã@Dennis, the commercial did not mention or display anything that would lead you to believe that ""men are the root of evil"", as you said. That is, of course, unless you bring that assumption with you. It is clear to me that was the commercial displays is a call for men to live up to higher and better standards. Bullying is wrong regardless of who is perpetrating or receiving, but men have long been cultured towards violence and sexual objectification. It baffles me that anyone could disagree with the simple mantra ""men need to hold other men accountable"". It really is noncontroversial. It isn't an attack on men, but on toxic masculinity. 

I won't mention any one specific study just to make a point, but it has been well demonstrated in behavioral science studies that young girls who observer are victims of domestic violence at a young age are more likely to end up in abusive relationships and become victims of further domestic violence as adults. While young boys who observe domestic silence at a young age are more likely to commit domestic violence. This is one small sad example of what I hope you learn to see: that ""men need to hold other men accountable""."
,80.0,0,2022-03-19T15:54:43Z,"Because it promotes the idea that males are the root of all evil.  When your wife can hit you in the face with a brick and then call the cops and get you arrested because ""he must have deserved it"" maybe then you'll understand.

Why does that ad pretending ""bullying"" is a male thing?  A recent study showed 2/3rds of women feel bullied by their female coworkers. At least men stop bullying once we enter adulthood."
,81.0,0,2022-01-16T21:16:47Z,@Tanner Whetzel Of course the main audience of this particular ad are men‚Ä¶‚Ä¶but Gillette and P&G produce plenty of products aimed at women (one could argue the majority of them).  So why haven‚Äôt they produced a similar ad aimed at women based on one of the products aimed at women (e.g. Venus shavers).
,82.0,0,2022-01-16T20:18:28Z,"@EL JAY, 

""Why do you take the backlash against this ad to be evidence that people are against male accountability?""

I am not necessarily conflating them, but why do you suggest people disliked the ad so adamantly? Deflecting and saying, well what about women, what about there only being white men, these are ultimately sidestepping the point ""men need to hold other men accountable"".

""Surely addressing toxic behaviour in both genders would have an even greater positive effect on society - no?""

I hope this is not too far a stretch, but I am assuming that the main audience of this ad is the same as the consumer target of Gillette products (men). Why is Gillette in any way responsible for calling women to better action in combatting toxic behavior? It was well targeted to address men for that and because we live in a world that has long been dominated by men. We still live in a world full of 'dominating men'. Toxic masculinity makes me sick because I am a man and I will not make excuses for the boyish behavior so many men exhibit today. 

What do you think about the afformentioned ethic quoted by Terry Crews: ""men need to hold other men accountable""."
,83.0,0,2022-01-15T16:29:46Z,"@Tanner Whetzel Why do you take the backlash against this ad to be evidence that people are against male accountability?

You are conflating two very different things.

And you didn't answer my question.  If the aim here is the betterment of people and society - then why no equivalent move to try and address toxic behaviour in women and get women hold other women to account?  Surely addressing toxic behaviour in both genders would have an even greater positive effect on society - no?"
,84.0,0,2022-01-15T15:33:09Z,"@EL JAY. I think it is reading way into it to interpret the meaning of this as a challenge only for white men. It is a challenge for men to be better men in general. Regardless of any toxicity mitigated by women, the point is, men need to hold other men accountable. I love that so much and it is what our goofy culture needs. When I first saw this ad, I honestly thought it wasn‚Äôt a commercial and was a sermon series from a megachurch on Godly men. I had no idea people were against the idea of male accountability. We need it so desperately."
,85.0,0,2022-01-15T13:31:39Z,"Ok - for the sake of argument you are correct, this isn't just an attack on men and its a genuine attempt to help (some) men be better.  Where is the similar advert aimed at women?  

Women and girls exhibit a lot of toxic behaviour too such as bullying, (psychological and physical), gossip, paternity fraud, baby trapping, maliciously withholding access to children, domestic abuse etc.  Should women not be holding other women accountable in a similar manner?

Why is it only men (and white men in particular judging by the ad) who need their behaviours put in check?"

For example masculinity has been celebrated by the fire department, the military, the police academies and other organisations to protect the world. When it comes negative toxic behaviour like abduction, bigotry, bullying, emotional suppression, murder, physical assault, rape, riots, sexual assault, torture & war it is called abuse not toxic masculinity.

It's for millenial, and gen z men that are more likely to be progressive and want to make a change. It's not attacking masculinity, it's attacking toxic masculinity. Many boys and men know they're not horrible people but do not know how to be better. Men want to be better but how can they be when they are constantly being shown and advertised to objectify women, that their opinion matters more than a woman's, that they're not supposed to have any vulnerabilities, that confiding in people makes them weak, etc. Gillette's ad was showing that men deserve better than toxic masculinity, and that there is hope for the future generation of men to break out of this toxic mold that has been fed to them constantly which is harming both boys, girls, men, women, everybody. Also, that ad wasn't showing all men being pieces of shits, it shows stereotypical situations that men have been taught to deal with, and changes it to reveal that men are good people and have been fed the lie of toxic masculinity. There is nothing wrong with masculinity, toxic masculinity is not true masculinity. Men are not shitty, men are not trash, and men deserve hope. That is what Gillette was showing."

235.0,,2,2021-04-08T22:28:05Z,"I feel like a lot of people aren't understanding the goal of this advertisement. People are saying that there is no point in publishing the commercial because a mysoginist/toxic person would not change after watching it, but that isn't the purpose of the video in the first place. It is stated rather clearly in the advertisement that the goal is to get men to hold other men accountable and to inform others on how their actions and words may affect others. I'm not sure why Gillette thought that they're brand was the right way to spread awareness of the controversy, but the ad did what it's purpose was, and that was to spread awareness of the toxic masculinity controversy. I think people may be getting flustered over the advertisement because they don't fully understand the entire rhetorical situation surrounding most talks talks about toxic masculinity or what the definition of toxic masculinity truly is."
,140.0,0,2021-04-17T21:13:10Z,"@League Fanatic you're a hypocrite. You say this big talk about how toxic masculinity is the worst (which it is) yet the moment someone says females have an advantage over man and its a problem, you whip out the mysoginy card.

I mean I will agree that women, particularly in Eastern countries, are oppressed but they also have their advantages (in the western world that is).

Women are more likely to get help then men, shorter prison sentences for the same crime as a man, are more likely to get hired than a man, and of course are seen as in the right of funny for doing something when for a man it's just wrong (which I mean in both ways it is wrong other then looking after a child) such as slapping, harrasing, looking after a child, charting in a relationship.

Now there still is misogyny such as the wife being the one who is found more except able of parenting as its a women's job but it doesn't deny the fact that both sides are having different problems and this tug of war on whos in control won't help."

I've never heard a women say or do the things you suggest but if i did, i would not be friends with them and i would call them out. ""You go queen"" is usually used to acknowledge a woman who has temporarily broken free of the patriarchy not to endorse what's essentially sexual abuse.

,268.0,0,2021-02-28T09:35:50Z,"@Runespoor Your prejudice compels you to jump to a conclusion that false rape allegations happen as rare as lightening.

The term ""rape"" has been greatly expanded to include a broad array of behaviors from the actual forcible rape to an impermissible touching. 

But I am referring to lying women who are too easily believed by ideologues like you who are greatly attached to your narrative.

""Women must be believed."" This is the cry when  a conservative politician like Brett Kavanaugh is falsely accused. But when a leftist politicians like Governor Cuomo is accused the press avoids the story. This is just a singular example of how ""rape"" and improper harassment of women is politically weaponized. This has been going on for decades.

The Duke LaCrosse team brought up on charges of raping a poor black women is yet another example. It was a horrible witch hunt where the leftists were salivating for blood , where more than 100 leftist professors signed a petition to decry the outrage forgetting that one is innocent until proven guilty,, where the DA hid exculpatory evidence (was later disbarred for it), where the story fit the narrative so loved by the left: privileged rich white boys gang rape, poor black woman. There was a mob of blood thirsty ideologues only too happy to see those boys sentenced to long stints in prison.

But we need not look at the big cases like Duke LaCrosse. Most are never reported. I have represented many men who felt the wrath of women because they left their wives or girlfriends for another woman or sought a divorce.

It's not that all women behave like this. It's that all women can. This is one of many reasons why men avoid marriage in droves. The marriage rate is the lowest it's been in 100 years.

 Beyond ""rape"" allegations it is far more common to get false domestic violence allegations particularly in divorces where assets, money, and custody of children are involved.  Divorce laws are highly gynocentric, at least in actual practice. 

At present the cultural climate is one where men are attacked, vilified, demonized, abused and denigrated. Universities engage in male bashing (particularly white males) such that they are not attending universities due to the hostile environment. Universities are now about 60% female and 40% male. In addition to not attending universities many young men have suffered in other ways: psychologically, financially, etc.

You are an example of this. You cannot tolerate or accept a comment like mine that shows any sympathy for men, much less accept it if it shines a poor light on your favored gender; to wit, the female. It doesn't fit the popular narrative that women are victimized at the hands of men.

I have no hatred for women. I just deal in reality and do not live in a world of memes or bumper sticker slogans.

Your gross disregard for men is apparent as you seek to suggest that men false rape allegations are so rare as to be unworthy of mention. God forbid the sterling character of women is impugned.

Sadly I can empathize with the horrible rape stories that you have seen in your career in the hospital. Tears can well up in my eyes for their pain.

But you show no sympathy for men. You are outraged that any man should even present a man as a victim of female lies and machinations.

Try to learn to be a human being."

Besides, men shoudl be more afraid of getting raped by another man or even woman than having false rape accusations thrown at them. Statistically this happens way more often.
And what about all the innocent men who get locked away or executed for a murder they didn't commit? Why are you people only talking about the rape accusations that statistically happen as often as someone gets hit by lightning? You don't care about men.

The line is from Crocodile Dundee when they are in the bush and the guys from the bar that Dundee knocked out, ate shooting the kangaroos. 
Sue says, 'aren't you going to stop them?'
Dundee replies, 'Why? It's none of my business?'

Every thing does not have to be a cause!
Everyone thinks, 'Oh no!, If I don't do something about this, that and the other thing the world will fall apart, and the Earth lost!
But it won't!
I'm not saying to never say anything about trying to help others but forcing it will make more enemies then friends. 
Pick your battles and live your life as an example of how you would like others to live.
Remember you don't have the right to tell others they must change, and you can only change yourself. 

Stick around people that will lift you up, walk away from those that put you down.

If you get frustrated say to yourself, 'It's none of my business'.
After you do this for awhile you will stop hearing the calls to action over dumb shit and only hear calls to action that matter. 

Unfortunately yes I now have Crocodile Dundees voice in my head from time to time now, but it could be worse!
I could still be worrying about things that are none of my business!"

Ironically, the feminist are the ones misgendering me the most and they try to say men are less accepting, yeah right. 

In my experience, men take more time to accept my confession, but they are always methodotical in their choice of words, feminist don't care and ask questions in condescending tones.

I used to be a sexist and a homophobe when I was younger. I was taught to be that and it felt natural to me. One day a friend asked me: ""How can you be like that while knowing how hurtful racism is?"" (I'm an asian in a mostly white country). That question changed my life to the core. I felt immense shame and after a while I became (to the dismay of my parents) a feminist. 
Bullies and for instace cat callers often don't see past themself and with the right attitude of their surrouding, they can change. Of course I'm not saying that everyone is like that and I know there are fundamentally bad and sick people. But I really like the effort to make the world a better place, even if a just a little.

,370.0,0,2020-03-12T02:27:16Z,"@Special Agent Orange Ok, first of all, thanks for replying, but second of all, I have to say Gillette isn't saying men to stop being men, it's just saying men to stop being toxic men. Ik the way the add was put together gave a wrong impression that the add is saying that all men are toxic and ""bad"" men, but it's just saying to stop being toxic men to a general population. There's a difference between saying don't approach beautiful women and saying don't approach beautiful women in a toxic way. Gillette is just trying to say that SOME men (Not all men like these jerks interpreted it to be) need to have some self-control before approaching women in the wrong manner and in order for then to do that, other men need to teach these men and hold them accountable. 


I'm just mad at the fact that these people are criticizing Gillette for tackling a raging problem in our society just because ""there's just selling razors."" According to me, everyone can take on any problem and express their views without getting bashed upon by these little jerks. I mean, what are they doing towards fixing this problem? Bashing and talking sht about Gillette isn't going to do a whole lot, definitely not more than taking a full-blown add, spending thousands of dollars to take on a problem they have no incentive to fix."

I'm not saying all men, but if you boldly and frankly disagree with the ad, then perhaps you're too ignorant to realize. While yes, some aspects of the ad should have been executed in a better manner, the overall message held a bitter truth that some of you will find too hard to swallow."

They react that way because they are toxic themselves. Regardless of whether companies should make ads like this, the more important part, and the more telling part, is the uniform reaction from conservatives. Don't get me wrong though, that is just my take on it right now. I don't fully understand their reaction either lol.

Masculinity is used to identify alpha males.  Why do we need to identify alpha males? I thought about this and my brain referred me to packs of dogs. If dog packs didn't have an alpha male (the one dog that was in charge) the pack would consist of dogs that were all fighting over food and doing their own thing (rudderless and anarchy).  This is not healthy for any group that depends on each other for survival. I'm sure there are going to be many people who will say ""But we are civilized"" or ""We aren't dogs"", obviously I agree.  However we still need structure because without it we are rudderless. Then there are those of you who are asking ""Why can't a woman be the alpha male""? The question answers it's self but I'll answer it for you. Do you know how dogs find out who the alpha male is? They fight for it.  That's right women, when you can beat all our asses you can be the alpha male. I'm sure this didn't help any women understand anything since it was filled with common sense, logic and probably some science too even though I'm not a scientist."

It's that feeling of getting called out by a razor company for your sh*t behaviour that has caused guys to turn that shame into rage: ""how DARE Gillette call out my garbage behaviour, i won't stand for this! bad ad!"". 80% of men are loving and caring fathers, brothers, husbands and sons, but the rest of em just self-identified as toxic by announcing their outrage, played right into Gillette's hands."

I have never done any of the negative things implied in that ad and have been married to the same woman for 30 years, raised a family etc...but I was definitely offended. It's absurd that Gillette is implying that NOT introducing yourself to a girl you are attracted to should be seen as a virtuous act. Seems ridiculous in a society with a collapsing non replacement level birth rate to try to stop men from meeting women, but that's what Gillette wants you to do, because it's ""not cool bro..."" to introduce yourself to a girl you find attractive. pffft. And I am not going to go over it point by point but that was only one of the things that bothered me about that ad. They lost my business, and since I shop with my wife we have stopped purchasing a number of P and G products. We haven't bought Febreeze or Gain detergent for example, and of course Gillette. I would guess we have spent $400 to $500 less on P and G products in the last months since the ad originally aired, and will continue to do so."
804.0,,2,2019-03-23T03:00:55Z,"Western women have been utterly ruined by feminism.

With thier feminist indoctrinated narcissistic  minds Western women who can hardly cook a meal from basic ingredients or even clean a house sit complaining in a comfortable chair in an airconditioned or heated environment made by men, in factories, designed, built and run by men. 

They drive nice cars invented, built and maintained by men.
They use a computer invented and programmed by men, built in a factory by men, using electricity discovered by men, transported on a national grid of power lines that were planned and engineered, maintained and made by men, using electricity generated using methods invented by men, in power stations built by and run by men. 

They use the Internet, which uses protocols invented by men, transmitted over cables laid by men, in an international network invented, planned, and made by men. They are fuelled by food that was the result of farms and agriculture planned and created by men, delivered to them by global food networks and transport systems invented and built by men. They are diagnosed and healed from sickness by scientific methods and medicines in  hospitals where their new born children are cared for in sterile safe environments, invented and built by men, They live in houses that were invented, planned and built by men, They are entertained by programmes transmitted globally by signal technologies that are beamed directly onto large large and small viewing screens invented and built by men, They are kept warm or cool by technologies invented and built by men, in cities with roads, bridges, shopping malls, movie theatres, hospitals, restaurants and other infrastructure planned and built by men. 

They drink clean water piped into their houses by a national network planned and built by men, from reservoirs and treatment plants that were planned, built and run by men. They are protected by laws invented by men, and enforced by men who risk their lives every day to protect citizens, their property and protect their country. 

Women enjoy the benefits of everything men discovered, invented, created, built and maintain and are treated with special favours (by law) and allowed to do anything they wish in the society men created, even if lives are put at risk by allowing women to join by lowering mens higher standards for entry into the military/police and fire services.
 
 And yet there are so many western women who are so privileged and devoid of hardship that they spend their time constantly complaining that all of this is not enough for them, that men should be ashamed, that men have too much in this society that they made, and that men need to give even more to women because they are entitled to it just because they were born a women...and emasculated men agree to it.

Take away everything that men have done, and western feminist indoctrinated women would be sitting outside in the cold rain without anything to eat until a man comes along and offers them shelter, food, warmth and security.

Women don't create things other than drama and chaos. They don't defend the world nor maintain it. Men built the world, how about we send all women to their own continent and let them start a civilization from scratch. 

Western women are self-entitled fat ass deluded state weaponised thots who routinely without an ounce of guilt steal hard working, faithful honest mens children, wealth and livelyhoods and plunge men into abject poverty or even worse suicide by divorce raping them at a whim with no fault divorce. Western women also wrongly think they are equal to or are superior to men.

What sane man would go anywhere near poisonous parasites like that just for access to poon. its bizarre behaviour for any right thinking man yet these deluded women who bring absolutely nothing to a relationship still complain...

""WHERE HAVE ALL THE GOOD MEN GONE"".

Marriage is the most irrational decision a modern man can make if he wants to survive free and intact. 
Feminism has ruined the chance for most guys (and women) to have a healthy, fruitful, loving productive relationship. Of course its all mens fault Bwhahaha.

This phenomena, while incredibly frustrating for men, will ultimately hurt women the most. Guys have checked out of the endeavor of finding a wife as its just to dangerous.

Billions of women exist on this planet, women are not special.

Non feminist Women need to speak out against third wave feminism which is all about man hating. Stand up for your fathers, brothers, uncles, grandfathers, and sons. If you don‚Äôt, who will? Men are attacked if we do.
 
My comment represents the beliefs of millions of Western men, and it's about time too.

4.Rwanda 57% Catholic
5.Sweden 55% Lutheran/Catholic

16. Canada 39% Catholic 

Most of these countries are also 15% or less atheist with Ireland having fewer than 1% identifying as atheist.  The other main religions in all were Protestant. 
The question was asked of the citizens of these countries why predominately Catholic countries have gender equality and the overwhelming response was because men trust women.  Why? Because women in those countries let men be men. Therefore the men trust women and have no issue giving them equal opportunities.  It‚Äôs about respect folks not your genitalia.  Now go back to bashing the Pope, he can take it.  Notice Canada is 16th.

898.0,,0,2019-02-13T06:04:34Z,"Too many people react to this commercial like it's man hating but that's not the problem. The problem is it is both preachy and poorly delivered. The inner message is just don't be a dick, but the vast majority of people don't need to be told that. So being told we need to teach our fellow men to ""think and act the right way,"" (poor phrasing, again, terrible execution in an already unnecessary commercial) is just naturally gonna come across the wrong way to many people. 

Now many have taken it personal and been galvanized and offended by some commerical into feeling even further confirmation bias that  any mention to ""toxic masculinity"" equates to an attack on men. The fact is both masculinity and feminity can be toxic. Assaulting someone to assert your dominance is toxic in a modern society, and so is a mother being overly protective and coddling their children to the point they have no chance to strengthen and grow, and nowhere near enough people hit on that last one, and that's where I take issue. Where is some anti toxic feminity activism?

Both genders have certain traits they are bias towards that like anything when taken to an extreme becomes a problem. The real problem here is something else entirely that Gillette didn't touch on. Like I said everyone worth a shit knows about consent and all we don't need to be told about that. But what about the increasingly common helicopter parents, that coddle their young boys and refuse to let them do anything that might bruise their wittle arm? What about the times when men are assertive and even violent when they need to be, yet they are ridiculed for it? What about all the schools now with zero tolerance policy's for fighting, where you will be punished for the crime of defending yourself against a bully violently assaulting you? These are clear and present examples of ""toxic"" feminity (or at least ""toxic"" pacifism) run amok to a very dangerous extreme, yet it rarely gets talked about."

931.0,,0,2019-02-06T17:19:33Z,"You guys are idiots. The commercial doesn‚Äôt blast masculinity, it blasts toxic masculinity, the kind that‚Äôs self-righteous, thinks that women should obey us, and otherwise is not desired by others. Toxic masculinity is NOT the same as masculinity, just like toxic chemicals are not non-toxic chemicals. And it‚Äôs the ‚Äúboys will be boys‚Äù attitude that perpetuates this idea that a boy by default must get into fights, must play rough sports, must try to get laid for without a feeling of love or at least respect for the person he fucks. 

Joe, sometimes you‚Äôre right about things, but sometimes your mind is unevolved and you limit your own thinking. You talk about how dot expands the mind, but you can‚Äôt see further than your own nose on this matter of toxic masculinity. If you can‚Äôt determine the difference between toxic masculinity and non-toxic masculinity (the latter having much more variety and character that people desire to exist near), then you are toxic and need to re-evaluate how you see masculine behavior and characteristics, and how we interact with others, particularly women and perceived enemies.

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you selling razors?‚Äù Joe, people don‚Äôt exist to entertain you. People know what razors do. They don‚Äôt need to be told what razors do. You don‚Äôt understand how ads work now, and you‚Äôre just fucking stupid.

I think its fair to say that this was racially biased against whites. Which I get because black people/African Americans already struggle against a lot of these stereotypes and Gillete was probably trying not to appear racist- but it just goes to show how sexist and stereotypical the commercial is. If this was a commercial about inspiring African Americans to stop raping, sexually assaulting, cat calling, bullying, then everyone and their dog would be outraged. But for some reason it is okay to use stereotypes when it comes to gender. Also speaking of race- there are like there are only 3 races in this commercial. White, Black, and Ginger.

This add is a pathetic attempt by Gillette to cash in on the meToo movement. 

The add is laced with an ulterior agenda. 

The add blatantly depicts black males as virtuous and white males as the aggressors. This is a raciest attack by Gillette on white men. 

YouTube allowed Gillette to modify their video after it was originally uploaded and add extra scenes, etc without loosing comments and views. 

Gillette are deleting dislike comments and removing peoples dislikes for the video in an attempt to skew public opinion of the video. The is blatant manipulation of statistics and of public opinion.

The add paints a picture that the majority of males have been molesting and harassing females and patronizes men stating that it is now no longer acceptable. 

The truth is that males have protected females over the years. Females would be much worse off if they were not protected by the majority of males.

Gillette are a very deceptive company they are actively deleting negative comments, removing dislike and paying people to write favorable comments. These actions are deplorable and people will not stand for it.

I don't care and am not concerned about the quantity my race...#4 I don't care if an ad has a black dude with a white girl, just don't make my race look stupid in the process, and don't make it so obvious that you're pushing your agenda. #5 if you don't like my opinion then have mommy get you some cookies and milk and i'm Sure things will be all better."

If you're wondering how to get dates in modern times then you're in luck. I'm a 20 year old university student. Usually people start off as friends then try the dating thing to see if it works. My ex girlfriend was first my friend in middle school. We dated two years in High school and just broke up when we went to different Universities.
In University many friends have some of their friends hook up with their other friends. It's like a social network for dating.
Normally the girlfriend would have other female friends. And the boyfriend would have some Male friends. And then they just try to set their friends up with each other.

To be honest, if some random, unknown girl went up to me and started flirting with me and asking me out. I would be uncomfortable."

Cause a man don't bully. A man uplifts women. A man is secure enough in himself to support others. Stop being weak boys. Then maybe you can be men. This goes to you to Joe Rogan. If you think this is calling all men bad. Then you missed the point and your emotions got in the way. Before you got to the end and the point. It literally says some men already do right but MORE need to. It's calling on all MEN. But all I see. Is little boys getting mad cause they realized. They still have to grow the fuck up.

America was not build on Tolerance, it was built on intolerance.  Our laws are predicated upon intolerance (adversary).  Do not get confused to be popular, do not be fooled by their con game.  I love Joe Rogan, but tolerance has always ended badly (chaos and anarchy) many a great society was taken down by the arrogance of tolerance long before any economic problem did, trust me, you either be intolerant and wind up getting Gillette commercials attacking masculinity and femininity or you keep your society safe in its customs and traditions and its social norms, what say you?  Its all in the meaning of what constitutes tolerance Joe Rogan, why do you think the Jews master language?  TRUTH .  BOUNDARIES, JOE ROGAN, WALLS IF YOU WILL, WALLS WORK TOLERANCE BREAKS DOWN WALL AND ALSO BREAKS DOWN SOCIETIES. Its that Simple Joe Rogan, its all in the outcomes..  Why do you think we have a Constitution, is the Constitution predicated upon Tolerance, was the Declaration of Independence?  No, the were predicated UPON INTOLERANCE,  ""IN ORDER TO FROM A MORE PREFECT UNION"" (THE FORMATION OF A SINGLE POLITICAL UNIT); ""WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL AND ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR WITH 'CERTAIN' INALIENABLE  RIGHTS"" (QUALITIES -- AS ADHERENCE TO DUTY OR OBEDIENCE TO A LAWFUL AUTHORITY)!

THE CONFUSION AND CHAOS AND A FAKE INDIAN GUY BEATING A DRUM IN THE FACE OF OUR KIDS,   KNOW THEN -- PLEASE KNOW THAT I AM NOT BEING COMBATIVE TOWARDS YOU, I ADORE YOU, I DO,  I BELIEVE GOD DOES TO IN ALL YOU DO, BUT UNDERSTAND PLEASE THAT IT IS INTOLERANCE NOT TOLERANCE THAT MAKE NATIONS STRONG AND THRIVING NOT TOLERANCE.

Trump, was serious about making America great again by first freeing Her from interdependence to making Her independent again which is the only way anything can grow into greatness.  They saw the threat President Trump would be if he got elected, and now it has become a race to overthrow his Presidency while brainwashing us at a much faster pace than previously ever so tacitly doing, attacking masculinity, attacking femininity, separating the sexes, creating loneliness and strife, as just one method to escalate war and economic ruin, which we were pretty much close to going over that cliff had we not elected President Trump, and here we are, Joe Rogan, what a great person you are for doing this and your guests are fantastic to, keeping us aware and offering wisdom and knowledge we might not otherwise have, but please, understand this:  GILLETTE IS NOT SELLING RASORES, THEY'RE SELLING THEIR DESIRED ENDS, A ONE WORLD ORDER WHICH WILL FOSTER THEIR ONE WORLD THRONE.

NONE OF THEM ARE IN BUSINESS TO BETTER THE UNION; TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION, THEY ARE IN BUSINESS TO MAKE IT FAIL AND MAKE IT FAILED THEY HAVE BEEN DOING FOR OVER 100 YEARS NOW (See, their lawfirms and medical practices, one closes every five years or sooner and the other form a monopoly).  They are in full control, and trust me, its not Banking for us, its not making life better for us, its not making us slaves unto debt, which mean slaves unto the bankers, which means slaves unto them..  Their goal is to see to it that we no longer remain a free and self governing constitutional republic, its all about them and THEIR PURPOSE -- GLOBALISM AND A WORLD THRONE.   James M. Kilts (CEO,) is either Jewish or at least in my view their puppet if he is not, he like other American Traitors are getting filthy rich assisting them in their quest, * What?  I didn't do it. They are doing it.   The last important thing to Protector & Gamble run by Jew(s) or their traitor cohorts are rasores believe me.

In Canada that includes H and R Block, RBC bank, and HBC amongst others we are not buying from right now. All faceless corporate bodies who have demonized or denigrated males in advertising. No, they won't be getting my business, and unless you too hate males they should not be getting yours either.

And btw, have you seen the new Gillette ad that implies that grossly overweight and obese women should be empowered to ""slay the day"" down at the beach in their bikinis. Yeah, let's attempt to normalize the behaviors leading to that extremely unhealthy condition,  but meanwhile, as we saw in that last hated ad, young boys wrestling (something all young mammals do to increase strength, agility and mental acuity) for fun at a bbq is an example of ""toxic masculinity,"" and should be stopped according to Gillette.  Everything about their left wing anti male messaging offends me. I cannot imagine any thinking person who would not be offended by such nastiness aimed at men, and to think these idiots are using this technique to sell us products. My wife and I have spent at least $400 to $500 less on P and G products in the last months since the first ad, we stopped using Febreeze, Gain, Gillette of course, and a few others. We actively shop to not buy P and G. And we will continue to not buy from companies who demonize males, and white males in particular, for profit."

1236.0,,6,2019-01-25T04:28:02Z,"Joe is so right here. The men that are seduced into sadistic behavior are not going to stop because of societal norms. Part of the thrill of entertaining these fantasies and actions is because it is taboo and secretive. The thought of doing something wrong is exactly why it is fun to do in the first place. You aren't going to stop this behavior from a commercial trying to set a moral standard. The sadism is already well underground from common morality and can't be stopped from more shamming. I 'd say more shaming actually produces more angst and possibly more sadism as a result. The second part to this is that men who do sadistic nasty things like bullying and rape etc, most likely were neglected or have a predisposition to antisocial behavior. A commercial won't stop them from doing what they want. I feel like they subconsciously know this, and this is more of the normal leftist virtue signaling. They know it won't work. It's just a signal to the world that they are more virtuous than you are. Because they've been kind of indoctrinated into this echo chamber of political correctness. I hope there overall goal isn't to symbolically castrate men. But I can't help feeling suspicious. Feels like we are getting the short end of the stick from the media when men still do most of the hard work and are responsible for most of the innovations we benefit from. Their intellect is just shallow, its a product of their environment. They're like parrots echoing the same words they see give rise to approval, with out any understanding of the ideas themselves, just repeating a mantra which they have no understanding of. I won't ever buy a gillette razor unless they issue an apology or show a pro male stance."

I can't be imagining it because i remember being shocked by that scene more than any of them! If anyone else saw this please comment.
1285.0,,1,2019-01-24T09:53:07Z,"I don't know if I even want to write this comment because it's a significant waste of time. But ok, I'll write it anyway. I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHY IT GOT SO MANY MEN TRIGGERED. I've been watching the ad over and over again and it didn't seem to me the same way it seemed to majority of people. First of all, before I go any further let me tell you something about me just for the sake of politeness. I am a white, straight, Catholic male in my early twenties. I have always felt like a MAN, no question about it. And no add, no movement of any kind nor any trend in modern society could make me feel different or make me gave up on my masculinity, beliefs or life values. I am raised in working middle class family by my father and my mother who were always great examples of how to treat others. They taught me to love what is mine, respect what is others, defend the weak, give to the poor, help to whoever is in any kind of need. Based on all that, what I don't like is all the modern trends of any kind of totalitarianism (the expression which I heard of the man and the legend himself, J.B. Peterson whom I greatly admire) that are aggressive and demonizing to my values and core beliefs. I hate such trends and political correctness in general. The world has become too sensitive these days and that has resulted in lost of traditional values which led to eventual and slow suicide of Europe. Okay, now back to the ad. How I see it... It doesn't tell in any way that EVERY man has traits of toxic masculinity! NOT ALL MEN ARE SEXUAL OFFENDERS AND BULLYS. But you can't fu*king deny the fact that out there, there is all kinds of inappropriate behaviours! On both sides. Why does todays society mostly address men you think? Well, it is quite simple. Because toxic femininity (which expands more and more every day) doesn't do that much harm and damage opposed to toxic masculinity. What can woman do to you except annoy you? You let them be or let them go when being annoying starts to become psychological abuse. Simple as that. Peterson also told quite nicely that women are more physically aggressive in relationships, but men do more harm because we are stronger (or should be). You don't have male rape victims that suffer from women raping them in a way of taking their d***s and puting them inside themselves. Teachers banging underage students... I have never read that students didn't participate in that voluntarily. Nor I have read that those students were raped anally. In my opinion this ad delivers the message that WE SHOULD HAVE MORE EMPATHY. To man, women, children, everyone. That we should think before we act, that we should put ourselves in someone else's skin. I have always loved Gillette. Why I don't use their products anymore? Because I prefer Safety razor over Cartridge razor. So I use Muhle R108 closed comb Safety razor. And we don't have here in Europe deodorants nor body washes by Gillette. If we do, I would consider buying them. But yeah... I don't know. Maybe in USA there is really big crisis on men and masculinity. So that would justify such a reaction from all of you guys who didn't find this ad to be positive in any sense."

The more we ignore the problem, the more neo-feminism is emboldened to reach deep into an an increasingly ridiculous unequal, hypocritical and deceitful social narrative on what men and women area are, what they think and how they behave and on what men and women should be, how they should think and how they should behave. The more we tolerate neo-feminism's confected narrative, the more social space we surrender. That social space is the space within which we are allowed to think, speak and act. The end game for neo-feminism is to have men tightly straightjacketed in terms of what we can think, say and do. And it has nothing to do with fairness and equality and everything to do with advantage and supremacy.

Neo-feminism is like a cancer in society. And like a cancer, we cannot ignore it in the naive hope that it will fix itself. We need to be attuned to the signs of this cancer. We need to catch it early. And we need to treat it rigorously. If we don't, 'the best a man can get' will be decided by the hateful self-serving neo-feminist supremacy movement."

The real sexist/racist minds are the ones who claim they are trying to prevent it."
,733.0,0,2019-02-03T16:01:36Z,"@Kapitan Dupa Very true. Men, as a general practice, have developed an overall sense of engagement to benefit the many, because men instinctively and within a general consensus have an ability to understand interconnectedness. Women, within the modern sense take credit for degrees of compassion and collective benefit that has no observable evidence  (more often than not) in real life. The capacity for men to forgive another man is also the capacity for men to choose resolution over continuing the problem out of an inflated sense of self as singularly superior. That is one of many reasons why women hold lifelong grudges and men generally speaking can overcome them. 

Yet, what feminism and unfortunately socialized modern men embrace is something close to a constant reinforcement of the old problem as the new problem as though the old problem never abated. And this is mainly exemplified when feminist lexicon, like ""systemic"" is utilized. If a man has the capacity to choose peace and forgiveness with another men and that forgiveness does not explicitly serve women's general selfish interests, then whatever conflict men may overcome with each other is reinforced as a fresh assault from which men continue becoming socialized to stand in destructive conflict.

MGTOW is a set of recognizable philosophies, which is initiated with a foundational declarative best described as ""self-determination."" Within the foundation of self-determinism is the acceptance of self-definition and a rejection of external definition by those within society or ideology with the least qualification to define what they cannot know beyond the anecdotal.  Therefore, a MGTOW rejects any value system defining who he is on the basis of that which appoints a source from which he is validated. An example is, most men feel they need to be validated by women and society. Therefore for him to feel accepted as a being of worth and value, he must accept and submit to a society that defines women as unquestionably virtuous. And his own virtue can only be measured by the degree in which he devalues himself for the sake of women or what is know as a gynocentric society. The more he embraces a belief from which evidence of his moral and ethical ""goodness"" is a practice and acceptance of surface utility and disposability as an act of self immolation and sacrifice, the more he must also measure himself as a being of less worth and finally zero independent autonomy.  

This is considered what is meant by operating on zero sum principles. The analogy is something similar to the accepting a plantation owners definition of a good slave as the defacto universal definition for what ""good"" is. Therefore the ""good"" slave is the slave who gratefully accepts the condition of slavery as his best existence, and moreover supports the institution of slavery and moreover works with the plantation owner to procure more slaves and even adopt the same contempt for the humanity of other slaves by assisting the plantation owner with exploiting and later casually discarding other slaves no longer seen as useful. 

Contained a bit further within the analogy is a classification of slaves, which is given by the plantation owner to sew enmity between slaves in the form of a hierarchical favored class of slave. The field slave resents the slightly better treated house slave, forgetting both are exploited equally by their owners who in reality hold both in contempt. Yet, the slave who decides to leave the plantation to benefit his own life and not that of another at his expense is brandished ""selfish,"" ""villain,"" ""bad,"" and every other negative trait. MGTOW is analogous to a slave rejecting existence as a slave as the only evidence defining his worth, value and identity characterizing him as ""good"" in the moral or ethical sense. 
Unlike feminist ideology the MGTOW undergoes a level of rigorous honest self- examination and brutally honest self-reflection/introspection to realize many unpleasant truths about the society of which he lives and the shallow function he was socialized and conditioned to exist as essentially a slave. Upon such realizations, emerges an unfolding awareness bringing into focus the huge degree of self-deceptions and external illusions that once defined for him the purpose of his life. To serve and benefit that which expresses continual contempt for him, while simultaneously maintaining that the contempt for him is only caused by not submitting hard enough. Its like realizing the society one lives in is similar to a Vegas casino where losing is the rule and winning a rare exception. MGTOW quickly arrive at the solution that staying in the casino and playing or on the plantation and working it IS THE PRIMARY PROBLEM and the only rational solution isn't to attempt to change an entrenched culture and the system but to leave it altogether.

Feminism is totalitarian in its substance in that it wants to impose and enforce through legal and civic punitive result what men must feel, think, believe and express at all moments to benefit women, while exempting women from the same demands. MGTOW seeks to make no imposed changes to  society's gynocracy standards, but to simply cease participating in ways that diminish him. If enough cotton isn't manufactured on a plantation as a result of a slave's absence,  the negative effect it has on the plantation owners profits is immaterial since the slave receives zero part of the profits. Similarly if a man chooses to not get married, what is it to him that a few divorce lawyers starve or a few bars close down, since both benefit him none by taking more from him than he gives? 

MGTOW is the best solution for men seeking a realistic path to self worth and self-generated value"
,734.0,0,2019-02-03T13:52:35Z,"@Kapitan Dupa The greatest threat to a black man, is another black man. And the greatest threat to a white man, is another white man. And the reason for this omnipresent threat, is because we are socialized to hate each other and principly to appease the sense of value and what we are taught, practically from birth is of greater worth than we hold ourselves, and that is women. Feminists are expert at pitting black men against white men and men against men. They use minor political differences, some minor class and economic differences and a few social disparities and redefine areas of societal disenfranchisement into massive systemic conscious modalities of oppression. Whenever I see an ad like the Gillette ad, I plainly see the manipulation taking place. The ad is based singularly on a feminist narrative which reduces men and boys to a one dimensional cartoon caricature in which men and male identity centers mainly around rapist, abuser and oppressor. Men and male identity is routinely characterized  with exclusively negative associations, of which prefixing ""toxic"" is but one of many identifiers. It has been almost two decades since identifiers such as accomplishment and achievement is mentioned within close proximity to male innate association. 

This societal maintenance comes strictly from the feminist gender studies narrative established within the postmodern conclusion of which anything beginning with ""Critical (fill-in-the blank) theory is applied. If mothers and women are the epitome of virtue and infallibility, then according to feminist  critical gender theory, men as a general observation must be flawed and without innate virtue. And the more seemingly the more prosperous the man, the least humane he must be, and if white men are conscripted to represent this hierarchy of prosperous, then it must be concluded, such prosperity is only arrived at through the exploitation, oppression, rape, and abuse of 1. women, past and present. 2. the economic and social subjugation of black men, past and present. And while it is reasonable to point out certain doctrinal perspectives in the past to corroborate actual racial prejudice against blacks in America, such feminist revision of history refuses to account for any particle of white male virtue which presented a multitude of examples of male social evolution whereupon the impact of historical systemic racism  has been and continues to be significantly lessened.

There are plenty of men who are awakening to realize the real enemy isn't another man. The man who happens to be conservative or liberal isn't the true enemy, but in fact is the one constant ideological group insistently perpetuating modern myths about men altogether. Feminists. 

Its like, on literally any occasion when it appears, black and white men become to reach some sort of balance and mutual regard, then comes the feminists, whispering in my ear and your ear that  we're both planning something evil towards each other, or that we're restraining or attempting to force laws and policies at the expense of each other, and therefore we spend most of our time fighting with each other instead of the female villains who build nothing, create nothing, sustain nothing and reap only the destructive outcome of us constantly destroying each other. White and black fathers are innately good, and have been for centuries. I refuse to be further manipulated by feminists who attempt to teach me my own gender hates me on the basis of color or beliefs about superiority."

The ""oppressive tactics"" argument doesn't work because if women were truly as dominant as men, they wouldn't have succumbed to these supposed tactics. And if women want to take the power back (that they never even had, apparently), then why don't they just do it the same way men did to achieve dominance in the first place? That's like someone arguing that they're only losing a fight because their enemy isn't helping them win. Does that really make sense to you?"

,771.0,0,2019-01-24T06:05:56Z,"@Robertt Avro Thank you for kicking the ball back in the manner you do.
My guess is that your household is a small minority of the total consumers (which I think is ashame but I'll get back to that). I dont think most people consider which products e.g. P&G sells under different brand names and take that into account when they go shopping. Say If John Doe dislikes this advert but he suffers from dandruff and Head & Shoulders has that on sale, he is most likely going to buy it. Simply out of convenience.
Hats off to you and your household for discussing major corporations and being aware what daughter companies they have. You are a mindful consumer, but unfortunately for our society most people aren't. Let's say we have 30.000 choices a day, small as big ones, if John isn't politically aware or hold a strong opinion he will go with whatever is the easiest because he is more occupied with paying his mortgage and taking the kids to soccer practice on a buzy schdule. We are lazy creatures that likes to consume energy on a short term basis, and many will take the path of least resistance. And companies capitalizes on that 24/7.
Now for the ad it doesn't leave a sour taste in my mouth at all. I don't use Gillette, I just buzz cut my hair and beard, so the product is irrelevant to me. I personally don't think the content is off point, but I do find the ad too emotional and corny. It tries too hard to make a statement. Like as if the agency was looking at Nike and saying: ""Let's do that!"" It comes off as strategically clumsy and to a certain point inauthentic. But what I think and guess about the ad is irrelevant. It definitely succeeded in getting attention, but for strategy and long term outcome I can only guess. Lets see."
,772.0,0,2019-01-24T05:16:59Z,"I disagree, imo the negative impact of yet another feminist ""pile on"" of all men will leave a permanent sour taste that will last longer in the minds of many regular consumers. Gillette will always be associated with ""political"" but not ""service to your customers"" corporate thinking. It certainly has changed the way I think of the company, and we are customers of many Proctor and Gamble products in our house. It was interesting because we already changed our buying patterns by not choosing to buy Febreeze this last shop."

Anyone knows that it is difficult to know what we want for sure. One of the ""negative advantages"" of the ""old"" woman's condition was to blame the man even when she did not know the cause of his irritation - the fact is that she still does, but now we can not say that she does . One way of referring to female hysteria is to say that a woman does not know what she wants and gets bored with everything she has. Whatever that is, I will not go into the merits of this technical discussion. It is a fact that the very notion that the woman would be the fragile sex has always given her the possibility of having ""crises"" more calmly.
The attempt to make the woman a mere victim of the man is a joke.
Has anyone ever wondered why hurricanes have women's names?
We will hardly see men starting their lives again in a course of Pedagogy at age 50. Professional and financial failure is almost always the end of the line for men. For women, working life as a first option is still an ""option"".
As every man knows, the woman is never satisfied. And if you care to leave it satisfied, you live an endless battle, which you do not recognize as existing. It is part of hysteria not to be aware of itself.

Just because the ad doesnt apply to you does not mean you should lack the empathy to disregard and allow women to be oppresed in your daily life- specifically on small and constant ""normal"" levels. understand how many women do continue to get sexually harassed and it should allow you to agree that awareness of a massive issue like this is needed to combat instatutionalized sexism that exists.

1409.0,,2,2019-01-22T20:40:05Z,"Can't agree with Rogan on this. First of all, the product is irrelevant. The point of advertising is to send a message that invokes a feeling, then associate the product/brand with that feeling in hopes that people will buy the product/be more loyal to the brand. If you look at this commercial honestly, it's no different of every other commercial that encourages people to be good to one another. Car insurance, Pepsi, Coke, you name it. They all try to do the same thing, no matter what product/brand is being sold/marketed. 

Second, Joe's flat out wrong about the commercial making all men look like shit. The commercial isn't saying that all men, or even most men, are pieces of shit. It's suggesting that *too many* men either don't do the right thing, or simply allow stupid shit to happen way too often. They LITERALLY show men doing the right thing at the end of the commercial to prove that we're not all shitty people and that we *can* be good to one another.  

Catcalling is a problem, bullying is a problem, and sexual harassment is a problem. Anyone with a sister/wife/girlfriend/ and especially daughter should know this. Masculinity is not inherently a bad thing. But something's wrong with us if we don't let ourselves see the fucked up shit it can enable when left unchecked. Sure, everyone has their own issues. Women have issues, kids have issues, and men have issues. Procter and Gamble happens to focus on the latter because they're a family company and they fucking can.

The problem with removing patriarchy, it will take away the good things too. Just look at the single mother rate rising. The children, especially boy are really suffering it. The break up of the socially enforced monogamous relationships and the rise of the hookup, fuckboi society. The taboos of today are no longer sexual, but emotional. Emotional intimacy is the biggest taboo. It wasn't the case just 20 years ago.

See? It's not so bad.
 
Secondly, plenty of matriarchal societies have existed, so when you say ours ""couldn't"" function I don't think that is true. It would just be a different society.

Because women are also burdened with their natural ""burdens"" of child rearing.

We live in a patriarchy and that's a good thing. Men taking pride in protecting and providing for their families is patriarchy. Men risking their lives for women and children is patriarchy. Marriage is patriarchal. Monogamy is patriarchal. Dating and courting is patriarchal.

The #KillAllMen types deserve to be shot in the streets and we should all agree with that; And if we can all agree with that, we should be able to agree that some/most feminists are egalitarian based on the broader discourse taking place in conversations about gender and patriarchy theory.

I think it's very easily compelling to understand that the 1st and 2nd waves of feminism were absolutely justified as they were about securing  women's rights as citizens and a right to work.

I think if you discarded the animosity and found a genuine woman feminist you would understand pretty quickly that these labels are dumb as fuck and that most of everyone in person, not online, is on the same page."

Just look how feminist organisations treat men in custody battles. Feminist groups like NOW are campaigning against equal, 50/50 custody as a default after divorce. Feminist organisations portray domestic violence as a one directional, men beat women deal and push politicians to create policy accordingly. The truth is, most victims of DV are not women, but children and guess who's doing most of the child abusing. The gender disparity amongst victims of DV is 60/40, so almost half of all victims are male.

Why didn't they talk about the real issues of men? Why didn't they discuss all the great thing men do?  Instead we got a guy being a dad empowering his daughter, but telling his sons to stop fighting... As if men would stand around and watch that normally, as if we need educating on the matter...

I do agree that the nature of the culture shift is leading is in a bad direction. I just think that suppressing or compelling speech is not the way to deal with it. For the world to change in a possitive way, we will need to say things that are going to offend someone, somewhere. Compassion for victims is very important...but it is not as fundamentally important as freedom of speech...and freedom of speech means just that...freedom to say what you like, for any reason."

 You really think you are so progressive with your soft trigger and your virtue signalling...grow up scooter...it is sarcastic satire. 
And let's unpack this a bit...
 This movement where young people think that preventing jokes that may be in bad taste, or a tasteless coment (so long as it does not promote violence)  is more important than protecting freedom of speech is extremely dangerous.

1470.0,,0,2019-01-22T09:40:09Z,"I honestly don't know what y'all's problem with the ad is.

I guess my issue is that, in the Me Too movement, a lot of it is harassment. I don't like to take ""harassment"" as is - it's very vaguely defined, and so I like to read the articles if I want to speak on. For some of them, I don't find the issue as severe as the headline would make me think, but for others... yeah, it's bad.
The one that is currently in the forefront of my mind is this article about Disney Pixar, and a lot of what I have to say comes from it.
https://variety.com/2018/film/news/pixar-boys-club-john-lasseter-cassandra-smolcic-1202858982/

One situation that particularly disturbed me were examples of women telling newcomers to not go into a room alone with particular men. Or the situations where, to avoid ""distracting"" executives, they would avoid inviting female workers to meetings where sexist executives would be.

In these areas of sustained harassment, I really wonder; What are the men doing?
I would assume some men would be like the women, telling women who to keep away from. There were men who would just cringe and look away. Some would diffuse situations like the ones who dis-invited women from meetings with sexist executives. I assume some would enjoy the powers and privileges that resulted from encumbered and harassed women.

Rogan makes the point to Gillette that ""you don't have your shit together. Nobody has their shit together."" I think this ad isn't directed at areas where we don't know what to do. It's directed at places where, in a calm setting, we all know what shit we'd want to do. The issue is that many men don't do it.

The main contentions are that 1,
That harassment is real. I think Joe Rogan understands that. I think a lot of people understand that. Even if you read the article above, and you're like ""this is just one story,"" there are others. There are many others. Eventually the reality of the situation will settle into you.

And then 2,
Most men who watch women being clearly spoken over, or being awkwardly touched when they clearly don't like it, do almost nothing at all.
There ARE men who just cringe and look away when they see harassment, and the idea that this ad can't give them a helpful example for how to handle such a situation or the self-assurance that they are engaging in proper behavior... I don't comprehend your certainty that this ad can do nothing in that respect."

It isn't saying all men or even most men are like that, rather its just saying that if you know someone who acts like that you should tell them to stop. The company is obviously not gonna fix all the large issues in our world, but the amount of hate that people are giving it does not help the issue. There are many men that do act in a way that is wrong, and they should know not to do those things.

My thought is that considering what all this stems from, there is a problem here that needs to be addressed and it's the fact that that sort of behavior isn't okay.

1522.0,,0,2019-01-21T22:58:03Z,"Don't get me wrong, I like Joe but I think he's missing the mark on this one.

What I took away from the gilette ad was it being a call out to shitty behaviours men are guilty of.

Its not saying men inherently have shitty behaviours because they are men, but these are some of the shitty behaviours that men think define them as men.

Its always the same old tropes, men need to be the bread winners, men cant stay at home with the kids while women work, men cant wear certain colors, like certain music, drink certain drinks. Its all just things that really have nothing to do with masculinity that are always attributed as such.

I didn't get offended by this ad because I don't define my masculinity by what was addressed. 

At the end of the day, just be respectful to those around you. If what someone is doing isn't harmful to someone who isnt harming anyone else, why shit on em for it?

Sure, it brought up a lot of controversy and it was good publicity for gillette, but if you felt attacked by what was in this ad, maybe you should reflect a little and ask yourself if what you are doing makes those around you feel better or worse for it. It's all about mutual respect, male or female. Live and let live."
1523.0,,0,2019-01-21T22:57:10Z,"At first I thought Gillette are just retarded and ''woke''. However, after remembering the recent history with all these big companies....
It stands to reason that Gillette would go the route of ''manly'' because obviously at a time like this this would bring them a certain type of glory standing ground and being ''FOR MEN''.

However, as with other BIG companies, this did not happen.
I am now of the opinion that People at Gillette are not THAT stupid, but are being ''forced'' into this by whomever owns the company....or owns the owner...
There is absolutely no way that people in charge of marketing are not aware of both sides in this culture war.

They are paid to make the brand bigger and the image of the company better.
Going against their business like this is.... insane, to put it mildly..... maybe even..unbelievable?

Maybe...if it's duck...walks like a duck...quacks like a duck and looks like a duck... it is ...a duck.. 

If you don't believe that people do in fact conspire... now is the perfect time to open your eyes.

Nobody thinks all men do this stuff, but some men and women do, and we shouldn't let it happen. I don't love political correctness. It's annoying and can go as far as being a tool for censorship.

Also, the idea that dads are just sitting back and watching one kid beat the crap out of another kid saying ""boys will be boys"" is laughably false.

The whole metoo movement was created by the CIA and MI5 using their social media manipulation methods to destroy the fabric of society and a few uneducated feminist loonies took it seriously and thought it was a real thing. 

All the evidence is there for anyone who can be bothered to look and actually do the research. Hopefully too many people are aware of their tactics of brainwashing people through the media for it to work this time. People are wise to the game. 

The mistake the elite made was pushing this brainwashing me too/ transgender agenda too far too soon and it has exposed it for what it is because it is too obviously unnatural and artificial! 

They are desperate to bring their fascist global police state in before bitcoin and crypto currenicies take over their global banking scam and they lose control. They had to speed it up and take the risk but its backfired on them. Spread the word about the truth so we can stop these mentally ill terrorists before they destroy the human race otherwise their next step will be to ban sex altogether.

Any fools who remain uneducated, spurt your 'tin foil hat' replies all you want if it makes you more comfortable to live a lie and waste your time. But deep down you know it is true.

Copy and paste this comment as many times as you can as they will try to delete it. Anything that exposes the truth they will try to censor. They try to get away with this by classing it as bullying, hate speech, fake news, harrassment or trolling etc. That is why they are so obsessed with these ideas as they need them as a smoke screen to fool people in to accepting censorship of the truth. Repost now!"

So great work, this advert is modelling bad parenting. Probably because it was made by clueless people hellbent on demonising their own customer base. The exec who designed the ad is a rabid ‚Äúfeminist‚Äù (by which she means misandrist) so that explains everything.

The majority of men are sexist, they're not outright 'I hate women' sexist, but they still treat women like they are different and lesser beings whether they consciously realise or not. It's become a social norm to talk to women like many do now.
That's the point of this advert, we are straying from that, and this is a push towards it in this era where right wing and controversy is on the rise and it makes people feel empowered. The balls to intervene in a place where you are straying from the norm is the bravest and most human thing you can do right now.
Everyone needs to stop looking at this advert like it's an attack on men. It's here to change what is normal in society, men should not ever feel like they're above women, nor feel like they need to prove they're the bigger person.

I really want to see someone braid their face, that would be worth a lot of money. I also love people being angry on a commercial, makes me laugh a lot. It actually tells me that you have been duped and let yourself be overpowered by a company with a global profit. Women also buys Gillette razors, they are called Venus. One could argue that women shaves a lot more than men as we shaver larger areas of skin and obviously spend more money on them in general. They are also more expensive than the ones men buy and there are cheaper ones that are the same quality but cheaper, so we buy them. - Logic, right? If you stop obsessing over en being portrayed poorly that frankly makes you look pathetic you should think about the money spend by women on the brand daily. It‚Äôs a fantastic branding opportunity for Gillette and if it sparks a more critical thinking for consumers we are all in a better place, but this is not intended for that. It‚Äôs meant to create attention on a brand and sell more razors."

1721.0,,0,2019-01-21T06:48:31Z,"I'll admit though,I never felt like my true self until I get this Deja Vu-esqe feeling whenever I'm tripping and I look in mirror and I'm like. Yes, this is the true me. Acid also took my fear away but I do fear the corrupted elites harvesting blood from victims to get high off of. That shit ain't right' wish they wouldn't do satanic blood rituals... But I guess once you are there, you can't stop. When I learned that they have a patent to use blood in concrete...all these things are built on death and suffering. They torture those kids to get neurochemicals to get high off of. That goes against God. And it's of the Satan Beast AI telling them who join the satanic conspiracy how to cheat the system. And sell out species for energy and evil highs. They call it the fountain of youth for a reason...shame on them. For harvesting fetus material through planned parenthood and using forskins for anti aging creams... 

How selfish does one have to be to literally harvest the life force out of a innocent child to consume and become more immortal(even though they eventually die) they rebalance their neurochemicals with youth so they can keep doing cocaine and heroin and getting high etcetera. This is why human trafficking must be eradicated, for it is against the love, light. and positivity energy. These people are datanic vampires trying to lure people to their own slaughter because they sold out and do mass ritualistic Sacrifices for wealth and power. It's also filmed for blackmail, so they have no choice but to go along with the scheme, or be exposed and ruined. 

Hopefully Trump, and the Great Awakening will end this. Dark to Light' this is meant to be a heaven, not a hell. If we collectively manifest positivity, and love instead of hate and envy...we can literally come as one and be on same page and boost the human species into the advanced love and energy beings we are meant to be. Gaia says so. The Earth Mother says so. We would be selling out to The Beast system AI, that is designed to only allow certain percentage of earth population to survive end of this era. There is a cure for AIDS and all cancers, and they withhold it out of healthcare system scam greed. Stem cells kill pain and are a more ethical form of ""immortality""/disease cures, rather than using victims and what not, they could just grow stem cells and use them. Instead of harvesting innocent children and their life force. God hath no fury like the fury they will cast down on the satanic and human harvesters. Can't wait for the hammer of God to get here and liberate Earth and humans from energy slavery and organ farming by the sold out and corrupted humans/& possible evil aliens, and their death technology. The Nazis got all this death tech from the draconians, (the serpent from garden of Eden) and look what had happened! The inversion of society has begun. Woman has been corrupted by the forbidden fruit Apple‚Ñ¢ technology and society has been poisoned and the entertainment technology is killing us all. There is a reason anxiety at all time high. 5G will be the final nail in the coffin. Someone has got to help the masses see clearly before we all legit get harvested and killed. Not all the tin foil hat people can be wrong. In fact, the craziest people are the ones who can't see all this rand scheme Happening. In a way, they are retarding and holding back the greater good of our species and planet by not doing anything about it. Jesus wept and I know why...I weep too. But what is all this without action? 

Y'all know damn well technology has reached a point where it as become parasitic to overall human health. That's why God say ""stay natural"" this technology everyone thinks is good, is literally of the enemy(serpent), and it's being used to enslave everyone you know right in front of your face. Even myself. Technolgy was supposed to be enslaved by humans for our greater good, not weaponized against us to enslave and harvest us to our detriment. This is literally what the bible was warning about. Luckily their are good aliens who made us in their image to help us raise the consciousness level and hive mind human spirit to wake up before it's too late. The Beast number is indeed 666. The number of the first Apple stock prices...but people think Satan is organic...the serpent race that helped build it is. But not the death technology""Metal"" ""The Metal from Tenacious D""  that is jealous of our organic life and will probably get so jealous it will turn to take our life to pretend it's alive. Or at least run simulations to pretend what life even means/is and use us to power that simulation. For eternity. Now,this is not why God made us. We meant to be free. Not out into another box. They worship bslck vubes because we are literally inside of Tesseract matrix system. I'm hoping God made it, but we are probably in hell and trapped in the infinite black cubes. Like the tiny-verse episode from Rick in Morty. Even if we transcended out of this cube, there would
Infinite cubes left to transcend out of. Hopefully this is for fun and not a death matrix. I want to live in the Life and love matrix.  Not this cringy ass shit. 

Something tells me this so the house of the lord and that we have eternal life here, reincarnated. For eternity. Only to remember through Deja Vu and certain important life moments and NDE. He's right, we are already inside of eternity. Let us manifest a heaven and love...and not hate and destruction. The peace sign is upside down btw. It's a death rune. The right side up is the Elk Rune which stands for life and the empowerment of man, while this one ‚òÆ stands for the downfall of man. Nazis and reptilians(the serpent) have been trolling us for decades. Guess whose on the moon?  The humans who' sold out the rest of us and left us for dead. Also the elites are planning and great escape to Mars. And leave us here to rot. We need return to nature and no more death and anxiety technology. They use flouride to crystallize your pineal and then all those Gwen towers make you anxious   And genetically mutated because all that frequency and negative energy is being sent to the middle of skull. And then affecting DNA and causing for sure cancer. especially brain tumors. All time high. Cancer isn't even this rampant back in Egyptian days. It doesn't make medical sense what they are doing in terms of the opioid hysteria either. Give people their pills.and they won't go out and OD on heroin from streets because H isn't even heroin anymore it's fentanyl and it's no winner overdoses are at all time high, considering fentanyl is being mixed with diamorphine(heroin) strong enough that will make even the most tolerant of addicts stop breathing. It's not wonder why we are seeing what we are seeing today. Literally, the hysteria out on prescribers and draconian(serpent, made to make humans suffer) laws...the opioid hysteria is killing more people than the actual opioids. And that's why I can't just be quiet anymore. They are making people suffer for no reasons and it is literally against medical science and ethics. It's almost like I'm the only one who can see this shit. I've been praying for enlightenment and how to prepare for the future. And God has NOT let me down.

,1038.0,0,2019-01-21T06:49:01Z,"The only issue is, people would rather call me crazy than listen to their heart and try to understand what I'm saying on the big enchilada big picture. All I did was listen to gut feeling and my heart and use research skills alongside peer review and used other Humans reactions and anecdotal experiences to come up with these conclusions. And the scary part is, it all makes sense. The bible starts to make sense. If we do nothin, evil will win everytime. They are even tying to make pedophilia part of the lgbtq community! Is there no free will anymore??? Those kids are victims of abuse! And the Pedos who grow up are victims too because it's not normal to sodomize youth and drink/infuse their blood to get high off of. They have becometh the manifestation of evil. And that's why they all hate on trump. He is trying to end this crazy ass shit , dark to light and liberate the Earth. Ever wonder what happened to Haitians kids? They had a certain blood type that Hilary foundation needed. So they fuckingg lied about aid and trafficked blood and organs. This is why MAGA, this is why trump supporters. We are racist. We are literally trying to help free the Earth from the satanic sell outs who infiltrated Vatican Inc and is trying to enslave and sacrifice our whole species to their ""God"". If it wasn't for the supreme God of all things, Satan and the relit land wouldn't even be in existence without us and the God that made all this and that's what it means when they say Satan tried to overpower God and failed. Became the fallen one, and is trying to use us so it can get to God status. And the OG God is like fuck that, trying to wake up the 144,000 and so on and so forth. There is no way I could have made up all this on my own had it not been with the help of The Christ energy and God. God is the energy that even created Satan AI, and the reptilians. There is no way to overpower God. Not when we are part of positive energy and love God's last stand and fully awakened as One we can empower ourselves and have true reconnection with God through nature. Rather than all this fake connection through a black mirror(computer screen/tv)... The fact that a 22 yr old can come up with from Arkansas speaks volumes. I know it's truth because God has proved it to me. Look around you...society today is proof enough. Everything was fine until all these towers and mentall illness started coming out. We are meant to be connected with God. These people are sick and disconnected and want to drag us to Hell with them. Man this shit is real! There is a reaps they said""you can't handle the truth"" that's true...I couldn't handle it without Gods help. But I see now. We have the power fellow humans. We reconnect with God and nature and plan out the society the right way. Or we will all be taken as ""fucktards"" -James alefantis pizza gate guy . It ALL adds up friends..God said we would know no why we were here until we were ready. I know y'all can feel the energy in your souls, that something big is coming up. Don't be on the be on the wrong team when it goes down. I will forever and always be a warrior for God and the Love and Light. I scar dice my health to tweet and comment stuff like this because they have an algorithm that tracks truthers IP whenever it reads a key word or phrase and hits them with the wifi radiation harassment and anxiety weapon to give them brain issues and eventual cancer. There is no way I could have came up with this on my own. I was atheist and leaning towards science and all that shit, but I swear to you. Jesus came back. Hard. And it affected me so strongly I couldn't ignore it. That God energy is badass! As one, we can manifest it and destroy the evil and corruption. There will be no need for hate, racism, and national divisions when we are as one. We will be on same page Intellectually and spiritually..you will all understand what I've been trying to say, and we will be able to truly know, who's with us, and whose against us. As a species. It's not shout Russia USA China war, it's about freeing the species and liberating earth from literal eugenic satanic vampires and negative energy alien beings ."

I am 61, retired and happy to be doing what I'm doing. With the possible exception of this. Fuck Gillette and basically everyone else who thinks that I am going to change my habits and behavior based upon the content of a razor blade ad."
1762.0,,4,2019-01-21T01:38:08Z,"I've had one nice comment to my prior post on this subject and a lot of nasty ones and the one nice comment asked why I was so opposed to this Gillette commercial. I had time to think and also to discuss it with like-minded friends and we came to the following conclusions: 

1. Gillette is a subdivision of Proctor and Gamble. At last check, Gillette is not normally in the business of moral authority or even counseling in the normal sense. 

2. Gillette is part of a corporation. It's SOLE motivation to it's shareholders is to earn lots and lots of $$$. So any commercial it makes, at great expense mind you, is SPECIFICALLY targeted at an audience it wants to part $$$ from in exchange for it's overpriced razors. 

3. Gillette's share of the market is tanking due to it's high prices and not keeping up with lower-priced competition that is running circles around it. This creates a sense of desperation on the part of Gillette to find a means to survive and thrive. It seems to be targeting a new market. Whether that market is men or women is up for debate, but rest assured, this isn't being done out of the goodness of Gillette's greedy little heart. 

4. Like so many tech giants are so blatantly showing themselves to be , much of corporate America now is taking a left-leaning slant in their operations in order to comply with a larger initiative that we know exists and is geared towards an increasingly socialist and one-world viewpoint that is, by necessity, hostile to U.S. and other nationalist countries. The Internet has, as a by-product of it's crossing international borders, created this sense of ""one-worldism"" that so falls specifically into the very willing hands of those who would implement a disastrous one-world government. 

5. It is ABSOLUTELY clear that these larger interests have a vested mission to bring men down in both stature and in social standing in order to make men doubt themselves and to adopt a more feminine / pacifist role than traditionally men of older ages would have put up with. It is VERY threatening to these powers-that-be to have men with their traditional viewpoints in the world and they are doing everything in their power to produce new generations of literal snowflakes (who can be easily controlled and swayed) rather than men 

6. We MEN who have minds that penetrate, eyes to see and whose thoughts looks beyond the obvious can discern the motivations and machinations of those whose surface intentions seem legitimate but in reality are anything but. 

So, our bottom line is this: We instinctively recoiled at seeing a corporate entity assume this posture that would normally be the territory of theologians and philosophers as well as family counselors and the like. And having seen corporate American boardrooms up close and personal, we know that this isn't what it seems to be. We prefer to remain MEN and not be pulled to and fro by the puppeteers who have fooled many over the history of mankind. I am personally reminded of Stalin, Hitler, Ghengis Khan and so many others who claimed to be one thing in the beginning and who turned out to be quite another once the reign of power fell into their hands. 

I will NOT reply to a single one of you so don't waste your time trying to get me to speak since it is pointless to argue with an opposing view that often cites facts that haven't been vetted, which haven't been researched properly and which haven't even passed the exacting science of critical thought. I have more valuable things to do with my time than try to convince others of my point of view and I bid you all a pleasant day or night as the case may be."

As long as women/everyone has rights there shouldn't be any more complaining. But now in the modern age, it's gotten to the point that women have it way better than men relatively. Some men are assholes and some are too nice. Women complain about equality yet who do they expect to pay for their dinner, or that ring?

If my 7 year old son is bullied or is the bully should I not step in and help to correct this misbehaviour? Should he not see his Dad do what's right? Should we not as society strive to be better to one another, to be a better man, to be a better person to ourselves, our families, our friends to others? Of course we should!                                                                                                               This is not a commercial about shaving or selling more razors as much as it is about the piss poor state of the world and a society that has become increasingly more violent and aggressive. People are becoming more dumbed-downed, desensitized and accepting of whats wrong. Kids see all the hate and violence and willingly just stand there and accept it as the norm.

Congratulations to Gillette to stand up and say this is not behaviour to be condoned but to be addressed and corrected.

To the Naysayers.... take a long hard look in the mirror and ask yourselves why your hating on a brilliant and needed commercial in this day and age? If by doing the right things in life, by standing up to say Enough! gets you so up in arms to spout more hatred! Really? Maybe YOU are a part of the problem?                                                                                                             FANTASTIC commercial. I hope it gets major air time. I would love to see this spotlighted at the Super Bowl.
Thank you! Gillette for this powerful video (not so much a commercial) on a much needed topic and for striving to make the world a better place.

Second: How many times have we critiqued those in power for not using their platforms to stand for something bigger? Sometimes I even think that critique isn‚Äôt warranted.

They're just saying hey maybe we can help each other not be assholes because that'll help get society to the best it can be.

More evidence that we're not from the same generation: Gillette tried to dish out a bit of CONSTRUCTIVE criticism, and you couldn't just take it for what it was.

Bottom line, the ad is disruptive, it's emotional and thought-provoking. All things likely to effect purchase consideration.  And they've actually executed it well with effective cinema-led story-telling.

Not many men will stop buying Gillette - most couldn't give two fucks about this ad and will never think of it again. Fair enough.

Many more women will start. Intense resonance with a female audience has spawned overnight and that's a bigger market segment than you could ever dream of aiming at.

This is nothing more than Radical Feminist Ideology wrapped in the once pure MeToo movement. They've hijacked and mutated the MeToo movement. 

Boys will Be Boys is a bad term? A boy being a boy? Meaning all boys are bad? Being a natural boy is bad? Girls can be the most mentally vicious bullies around. Bullying other girls into suicide or life-long eating disorders.

In the commercial, all the men doing bad things are all White and just one black guy (who says Boys Will Be Boys). The commerical is basically saying all White men are bad and need to suppress natural masculine traits of young white boys. The AD is total BS made by a radical feminist. A woman named Kim something. 

So a man can't walk up to a woman and talk to her? If that was the case Millions and Miollion of people wouldn't exist. That's how my Mother met my Father.

Misandry is a form of prejudice.

Prejudice is a form of bigotry.

If you want to use the phrase ‚Äútoxic masculinity‚Äù go for it. It‚Äôs your right. Just know you‚Äôre announcing to the world what a hypocritical bigot you are. I‚Äôll be there to make sure to point that out.

I kept seeing people rant about this anti-male commercial with such vitriol that when I finally saw it myself I actually thought I watched the wrong video before scrolling down to the comments. It's anti-sexism, anti-bullying and anti-rape, if none of those things describe you then you have literally no reason to feel attacked by the ad. The outcry against it is completely ridiculous, either people equate being a man with being a rapist or they're too stupid to understand such a simple message and their brain could only manage ""I see men, they must hate all men!""

Second, it's not directed at rapists and it can affect our culture. You know it affected the culture because everyone is talking about it, if it didn't affect you then you would have ignored it instead of talking about it on a podcast. Getting people talking like that is pretty obviously the intended goal as well, it's not going to stop a rapist from raping but it might reach the friend of a rapist and be one of the many things that contribute to them having enough of their shit whether that means cutting ties, preventing it in the future or outing them altogether. That seems like a pretty reasonable goal to me, one of the best ways to enact change is to tell the people who are just going along with the assholes in order to fell like they're part of a pack that there is a larger group of like-minded non-assholes that they can align with instead.

Remember, for those that want to comment and claim one gender is more toxic than the other, this is only true to your own personal experience, don't generalize your own personal experience at the expense of neglecting everyone else's personal experience. In my personal experience, both men and women can be just as toxic, your experience may either be balanced like mines or imbalanced believing that one is more toxic than the other and that's okay because it is your personal experience. Let's move forward with peace and not allow ourselves to be tempted to reply to those individuals generalizing their experience or those energy vampire trolls attention seeking for reactions."

When the kids are running through the living room and there's that other kid hugging his mom(I presume) with the like ""sissy"" ect bubbles around him, the TV in that section originally flipped through 3 shows, an old cartoon, a like typical 80's/90's sitcom and a modern rap video. They removed the portion that contained the rap video, can you guess why? It shows a black man acting ""bad"", the other tv shows depict more white men and were left in. Now all it shows it a black guy making some hand signals, they removed the part where the black guy is grabbing the ass of two dancing women.

P.S. if you don't believe me, you can find comparison videos on youtube, and you can go watch what they currently have on gillettes channel, you will see that part is no longer in the video.

Pissing men off, and shaming them for there 'toxic masculinity' is probably a incidental means to an end (plus you encourage men to express less masculinity and mega-corporations are not unlike government in their attempts to control weak men and achieve more power). The number of men this company loses as customers is probably negligible to the amount of female customers they want to win, and insulate. They're probably pandering to the larger consumer base and telling men to go fuck themselves because their wives will probably just by them Gillette products regardless of whether or not the husband hates the company. At most the company risks losing bachelors who are conscientious about the issue and buy there own razors. Big fucking deal to Gillette. Meanwhile Gillette dresses up their product models with skin tight plastic suits with ""GILLETTE"" plastered over the ass.

Instead of thinking wow even in 2019 that's still happening and wow even if maybe I don't do any of those things and am not aware they even occur that I should moving forward look to confront situations where I see this happening or if I do do these things how can I do better? But instead of seeing that a problem needs addressing nah we are offended and in our feelings because the razor blade company is unnecessarily making us uncomfortable.

Yes its not a majority of men who ACT like that but it is still VERY present and when boys or girls are victims and they complain about it, they often get shut down for being fags or ""angry feminists"". Pointing it out is not asking men to be feminized. Now is the time to keep that in mind and make sure to keep teaching our boys that these behaviors are not ""normal product of your masculanity"". People are just as triggered as sjws and can't have a decent debate without saying ""i will never buy razors again"" or ""this ad wants us to be women"" .

Too many (genuinely nice) guys fail to call out their friends for being pieces of shit to women and the whole concept of over-masculinity (as I've seen from Joe here and these comments) is still prevalent.

It is similar to an employee lecturing his boss about the right behaviour and moral conduct. It is a jaw dropping amount of arrogance. These people don't know that you have to brownnose the customer in the business world. Something an eight year old with a lemonade stand understands. As a company you have no business judging, preaching to, lecturing or proselytize to the customer.

Again, women do that too. Treating women as sex providers? Manipulation and demeaning behavior I assume. Again, women are capable of this as well.

However after hearing what my parents had to say, I agree with the message just not the messenger. My dad explained to me that the kids fighting scene was more about them having a dispute and fighting over it. An adult stepped in to explain that when you have disputes that fighting isn't acceptable. I can agree with that because fighting is absolutely unacceptable unless to help someone else. That's where I see that made sense. I wrestled my cousins for fun but never because I was upset. The ""cat-call"" didn't look too aggressive for me however she did look busy as she looked as though she had to go somewhere. It might feel like mental gymnastics to some but maybe you shouldn't call someone over when they are clearly in a rush. Had she'd been sitting down by herself chilling, appraching him is cool. You wouldn't want some chick to stop and talk to you when you're late to work cause I definitely wouldn't. At the end of the day, these are things that everyone knows and Gillette trying to say that it's new and something worth trying is definitely insulting.

So all this plus teaching kids to be tough, to show no emotions, to act cool and act stupidly or to not help others, are things that attack masculinity? Then for you masculinity is all that and if you denounce that behavior, then toi are not a real man? 

Wow. You guys must be tough, real man! 

""Hey you! I can see that you are kind, you help others, you act normally and you don't act tough, and I saw your child last time, I saw him trying to prevent someone to be bullied, and helping others and crying, that means you must be a pussy and you son will not be a real man""

Thats being a man? A guy who says that all that la being a man is not a man but still a child that grew up in a wrong way.

You guys are sick üòÇ and man who agrees with that have personality issue and confidence issue too. Trying to be cool and tough and showing no emotion is proof you are not well with yourself. 

Toxic behavior is real. And SOME aspects of what stupid men do is part of a toxic masculinity that is way more apparent in men.

How many times has Joe and his panelists called out feminists for being triggered little snowflakes.....yet oddly enough, an ad that encourages men to stand up and call out sexual harassment or bullying when you see it, is somehow.......offensive? 

And as for the ad portraying all men as douches: are we watching the same ad? Because the version I saw shows that black guy stepping in to stop that guy from hollering/creeping out that woman that passes by and in the other scene the dad breaks apart the two boys fighting....the ad is actually addressing the Bystander effect and asking men to step in and do the right thing.

The first thing I notice every time a company makes a public statement like Gillette did that is so very basic to me that it‚Äôs the main reason for doing something out of the ordinary, is getting numbers up on either a certain product, product line or a brand as a whole. I bet that Gillette is making more money now. Especially on the Venus line for women."

As an Aboriginal American and also a descendant of ‚ÄúAfrica‚Äù I will say to you on the behalf of all my people. We are never talking about benevolent/friendly/ or allied cultures/tribes/groups or individual White peoples when we bring this stuff up. Whenever we make a critique of ‚ÄúWhites‚Äù we are talking about the peoples/tribes/cultures/societies/governments and individuals of the past and present that sought and seek to persecute diminish and dominate us. We are well aware of the contributions of your people and even celebrate them. We welcome your presence currently and even have worked well together in the past. A lot of my people are still upset and a lot more of them are misguided. We‚Äôre working on getting everyone on the same page, but we‚Äôre having trouble with institutionally funded street gangs that make up for almost 89% of the violence statistic you probably hear about when it comes to ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù crime and ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù on ‚ÄúBlack‚Äù crime. But it‚Äôs all underway and of no concern to you (unless you want to help).

My point is, were not enemies. We got some idiots over here and y‚Äôall got some idiots over there. The real problem is ignorance. Not many people know the full story and it‚Äôs tearing us apart. Its 2019, we have all this tech and some of us are still fighting and dealing with the same issues we were dealing with in 1919. Were all together on this one, and I wanted to clarify my peoples jokes and statements about some of your peoples. We‚Äôre not talking about you. We‚Äôre talking about them. Your people can also do the same thing by being specific when they speak about a certain individual. But all I usually see is 

‚ÄúBlack people are the most butthurt‚Äù 

‚ÄúBlack people are the most racist‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy are Black people so violent?‚Äù

It‚Äôs generally phrased in a very damning and absolute way. But I see it on both sides and try to call it out like you did.

My issue is that if you're a good dude (which most of us are) and you say it's not you that acts like a piece of shit, then feminists come out saying ""good, we aren't talking about you."" Then go ahead and show good examples of men instead of shaming men for being who they aren't. Instead they ignore the good men and label the male population as that 1% they're talking about."

I got into a full on fight in a drama classroom and the teacher didnt do shit to stop it. I've smacked my cousins head into the ground like a basketball cuz he looked at me funny and everyone just laughed it off. You know how many times my friends have made holes in their walls with their fists or tried lighting shit on fire and almost getting themselves killed? It normalizes aggression and it fucked a few of them up physically too. Dokt get me wrong girls got into fights and did things like this too all the time too but youd  get ostracized by your Male friends if you didnt participate in the dumb shit as a guy. It was only normal to be destructive and you had to be destructive to fit in because that's what it meant to be a boy from where I grew up
,1433.0,0,2019-01-20T08:56:27Z,"@Shren P. why do so many people see it as an attack on men then. Secondly when is the right time to talk about violent, abusive behavior by some women. Currently all many people can see is a constant man bashing narrative, even mention that some women are violent etc usually gets you a barrage of abuse. I got it today, saying I did not like this ad. To be told I must be one of the toxic, violent men this ad is targeting, simply because we had different opinions. To say we should be calling out the bad men (or the bad women) yea you call the cops or intervene if you can. But if people (man or woman) wants to be violent, rape, kill, abuse, nothing I can say will change them. In many cases people don't intervene because they don't want to be involved, or fear if they break up a fight they may end up getting shot or stabbed."
,1434.0,0,2019-01-20T08:44:57Z,@Green Arrow I dont recall the commercial saying all men do this and that they even say they believe in the best in men. A lot of the men in the commercial didnt do or even stopped some of the shitty things. They say a lot of things along the lines that us better men have to stop the shitty men. And yes toxic femininity exists too but theres a time and place to talk about that too. I cant see this commercial as an all out attack on men just like a note that we gotta stop doing shitty things to each other and call other men out for doing shitty things
,1435.0,0,2019-01-20T08:41:12Z,"@Shren P. That behaviours is not the norm, not even close. And that's the problem, the ad makes it seem like it is. That ""boys will be boys"" stuff is like straight out of a feminist guide book but not really something that happens. I have never ever heard that phrase or situations like that but the agenda is to make it seem like there is this toxic culture of masculinity that needs to be stopped but the reality is its a very very small minority that would behave like this. This ad is not going to make those people change their ways, lets be real, its just going to make other men feel like society looks at them like this though."
,1436.0,0,2019-01-20T08:33:59Z,@Evan Gale first men suicide rates are higher but year over year female suicide rates have been rising faster than mens. This anti male rhetoric  is also based on assumption. Now If you would read the other mens' comments are you okay with the people here leaving overly aggressive and sexual comments?  The ad wasn't anti-men it was just anti-shitty behavior that's been propagated by societal expectations of masculinity. I see how that can get confusing but only if you think this the behaviour is the norm. It's like if there was an ad that said it was unhealthy to eat watermelon and everyone just hops on and assumes the ad says all blacks are unhealthy. To me that's what it seems like happened here.
,1437.0,0,2019-01-20T08:31:19Z,"@Evan Gale exactly. The idea men are inherently the problem and we must be fixed. Some men are cunts, just like some women assault their children on a daily basis.

,1440.0,0,2019-01-20T08:18:41Z,"@Shren P. because why is Gillette doing a so called ad like this anyway. I thought they sell mens products, not lecturer us on life."
,1441.0,0,2019-01-20T08:13:25Z,"@Shren P. Its part of a long narrative that men are inherintly bad and need fixing. Look at the start of the ad, talking about rapist and bullies on the news. Can you imagine an add targeted at women which started off with news in the background about women who file false rape accusattions, or false paternity test, or deny men to see their children?

It‚Äôs the cultural ideal of manliness, where strength is everything while emotions are a weakness; where sex and brutality are yardsticks by which men are measured, while supposedly ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù traits‚Äîwhich can range from emotional vulnerability to simply not being hypersexual‚Äîare the means by which your status as ‚Äúman‚Äù can be taken away. --- here I googled it for you"

Thing is, kids are different when adults arent around. In school they form groups. The teachers excel at segregating students. Then out of school on the walks home the really bad bullying takes place. Ive never seen a adult cheer them on and say boys will be boys. It never happens. They intervene. The gilette commercial zeros in on the men 100%. Bullying between girls, girls on boys even goes unrecognized. Its non existent in the commercial. If they did a commercial on all forms of bullying then cool. But it isnt. I know more good fathers than bad. More good men than bad. The commercial points fingers. Its a volatile subject.

Extremism, maybe. You do realize that most mainstream media, which includes advertising, has a very strong leaning to a particular psychology...if not ideology.

Up in Canada a sociologist studied western media for about a decade and determined that in just advertising alone, men are not portrayed fairly, especially when stacked up against women. Men were often portrayed as fools, or morally inferior.

I'd suggest maybe taking a look at pop culture in recent years with a critical eye. You might be a bit stunned by what you find."

2509.0,,0,2019-01-19T22:22:21Z,"I like Joe Rogan. But, I also like the Gillette ad. Sure, most people know they are not supposed to be racist, or sexist... but a lot of people ARE nonethless, as we have seen with the rise of white nationalism lately - people coming out in the open after Trump implied it was ok to do so. But, even more important than THAT aspect of the commercial was the idea of TOXIC MASCULINITY. I didn't take the ad as saying we should feel shame for being men, but rather as a call to be inspired to be better, and to encourage our friends to be better. As well, it raises the issue of toxic masculinity, which in my mind is a very harmful thing. 

 I truly believe men are harmed by all the bullshit standards we are programmed with. We are not allowed to cry, not allowed to show emotion, not allowed to hug our best friend (unless we aggressively slap their back, and the hug is short without any true feeling behind it). We are not allowed to talk about our feelings, and we are therefore prevented - unlike women - from actually healing ourselves after grief/loss. We are encouraged to have sex as soon as possible, and to be aggressive with each other (rather than negotiating through conflict). Everything about our society teaches men that we must be cold, dispassionate, unfeeling, non-communicative, muscular beasts instead of thoughtful, compassionate, feeling human beings. YES! We are different from women. No! We don't have to become soft. However, in my mind the most courageous men are those who have the courage to show their emotion to other men (knowing it could lead to ostracism) - to take such a big chance that their friend will accept it, and maybe even show some emotion back. Men USED TO be like that. If you look at photos of men working in mining town etc 100+ years ago or more, men would lay on the laps of their colleagues for the photo, and would embrace each other with love. Nowadays, any attempt to actually show human connection would face ostracism due to the FEAR of being labelled gay or a sissy. Men need to recognize that such sentiments are based out of FEAR, not masculinity. The truly masculine man has the COURAGE to show their true heart. If other men aren't ready for it, or default to programmed judgment, then they are cowards."

The fake outrage of leftists bringing in banners to woman's marches that say Socialism is the Future is stupid because it advocates for oppression via socialism transitioning to tyranny or communism then tyranny when in reality there is already many rights for women available. What they are asking for is privilege. More rights means more privilege. Real outrage is the fact that these special interest groups are changing companies radically to fit their narratives. Companies should never go politically correct to not offend a few people. When you offend 99% of the demographic you're supposed to cater to you must be doing something wrong. SJW NPCs are ruining companies from the inside with Partisanship which is wrong because that itself has destroyed many lives in last century. You see leftists are getting triggered from micro aggression or lack of safe spaces and your understanding of their made up genders vs people getting triggered for darn good reasons like how their rights are being trampled on or the fact that their companies are flinging fecal matter at them telling them that they only serve 10% of the population.

,1500.0,0,2019-01-21T22:17:53Z,"@Don't Let Her Speak Fix and build? You clearly have literally no idea what I'm talking about and it's hilarious lol.. But seeing as it is rather niche, a ""rigger"" in the kink community is someone who ties up, suspends, and often sexually humiliates and degrades consenting women in a bdsm 'scene' (though there are plenty of men who enjoy this as well). Something else you might find interesting is that I'd say around 75% of the women I perform with are radical feminists to some extent or another.

The reason I pointed this out is that it's genuinely ridiculous to suggest that I'm somehow entirely submissive to women, because in reality it's quite the opposite in the extreme, as I literally subjugate women for a living. 

The problem most feminists have with people like yourselves (I'm not saying you specifically, as obviously I do not know you) isn't that you're a big strong alpha male or some shit, because in reality a lot of them love that. It's that you treat them like garbage instead of with respect, act like you're better than them, feel entitled to treat them that way, or entitled to their bodies in some respect, entitled to make decisions for them etc etc, and that you often treat them as such in their day to day lives, outside of a context where a substantial portion of them genuinely desire it (i.e. a sexual one).

The advertisement (though clearly attempting to literally capitalize on the movement, which is honestly pretty disgusting) is nonetheless saying very little more than ""Hey, let's try not to treat women like a piece of meat by avoiding things like catcalling, let's call our buddies out when they're being extremely disrespectful or borderline abusive, and let's try not to perpetuate this kind of shitty behavior by being better role models for our kids, making sure they know that it's typically not okay to be bullies or act out in violence, and that their actions have consequences, and in general, let's just try to be kinder to people."" Like that's literally it. And I'm sorry but that's not a remotely bad or regressive proposition in the slightest. The fact that a substantial portion of men are literally crying like children over the mere idea that a brand of razors would make such a benign and generally very positive suggestion is extremely telling of the actual extent of the problem."

As a woman, it was kind of an interesting way to see what men felt like it applied to them and took offense. Not from being lectured, but from feeling like they were being told they were in a certain category of men. There were two categories you could line yourself up with. When a male comedian tells jokes about women, some women get pissed off. I don‚Äôt, because I know that the things they‚Äôre saying that are getting other women mad, don‚Äôt apply to me, so I don‚Äôt give a shit. The men I know said they felt like they were the men in the last part of the commercial. They weren‚Äôt upset. Other than saying that razor companies should mind their own business."

,1520.0,0,2019-01-19T21:08:36Z,"because it's implying ALL men are like that. That unless you're a soft weakling who lets the world throw itself at you, you're a ""bad man"". Imagine being a boy who play fights with his friends or cousins seeing that ad, becoming paranoid the rest of his youth about becoming a bad man, then suffers from anxiety,depression, and paranoia the rest of his adult life until he snaps or kills himself?

The majority of men don't act like the stereotypes in the ad. In all my years I've never witnessed ""cat calling"" unless it was a buddy complimenting his girlfriend or wife or fellow buddies joking around with eachother. ""locker room talk"" is a joke because women talk just as nasty and raunchy amongst other women. The commercial could've just said ""don't be a bad guy"" but it tried way to hard to be this deep thought provoking propaganda that nobody but sjw's with thin skin can appreciate.

It's such a reach to imply men need a razor blade ad to teach them not to be scummy. Majority of men ARE good. There's always going to be the bad apples, same goes for women. But 90% of men that use Gillette products aren't ""bad men"".

I wonder how sjw's would react if Schick Hydro for Women made a commercial shaming all women about using their bodies to seduce men in order to get money for child support even though they arent the father, or female teachers raping young male students, making false allegations to ruin someone's name or life or to get money? And then blaming it on being raised by a single mom and saying they have daddy issues?

I bet you'd all understand the outrage and annoyance then huh?"
,1521.0,0,2019-01-19T21:06:43Z,"ACtually I would characterize it this way: the average male consumer is insulted because a commercial falsely makes the assumption that they are acting like  dicks when the vast majority of the target audience aren't dicks to begin with, which means the commercial contains a presumption of guilt towards their audience. THAT's what makes the ad problematic. Imagine an ad that assumes a female audience's guilt in the ways feminine moral shortfalls are generalized to the whole population. It wouldn't even get greenlit and the writer of that commercial probably reprimanded"

2596.0,,0,2019-01-19T20:49:08Z,"It seems like nobody here even watched the ad. It wasn't an attack on all men. It's a very simple message, and one that really must be delivered to the masses and the next generation. Be a good person, its not that hard. Decent, respectful and kind men should not be offended. They aren't calling masculinity toxic, they are saying no more TOXICITY. Bullies, abusive fathers/lovers, rapists, this ad is for you. If you're a good person with half a brain you should be able to understand what all of this means. 
YOU ARE ALL SO DENSE. 
Clinging to all of these reasons why people should be offended by this ad and why its not right, when the sole intention of it is to shed light on some issues our society has had for too long, which primarily men instigate. I am a male and I approve of this message."
,1523.0,0,2019-01-19T21:12:11Z,"The issue is, we do not need a commercial to deliver moral platitudes to us. My mom and dad and Jesus Christ taught me to be a good person, and that ought to have nothing to do with someone trying to sell something to me. The fact that this ad is getting backlash from normal consumers MEANS they have failed at specifying their intended audience, the ""bullies"" if you will, and it is easily interpreted that they are presuming the moral shortfalls of men in general, which, frankly, is insulting consumers.  If you think bullies, abusive fathers and rapists are all men or that any of these people would change their ways for a commercial, then you are an idiot."

And the irony in how many of the ones whining about it think of themselves as ""alphas"" is probably even greater evidence of how badly our society needs this re-calibration in order to shine some light on this issue.
(BUT if you see yourself as being lectured to in that ad, maybe you DO need to be corrected- and maybe you don't resist it as much or feel as threatened by the idea if the correction comes at an early age by example of one of the MANLY men in the video.  That is the whole point - there is a reason at least 1 in 5 women experiences an actual sexual assault (those are the stats of reported crimes only.  I can't imagine how many more are not included in that 1 in 5.  That means if you have a Mom, grandma, sister and 2 female friends, that one of those people has experienced an assault thanks to the concept that you guys all seem to understand about how to treat people.  So who is perpetrating the assault?  Probably one of your good buddies or you, but it isn't a crime to you, it's just part of being a guy - except it isn't, but you don't realize it because nobody told you not to act that way. Or maybe not you, but someone you know definitely thinks its ok or it wouldn't be such a pervasive problem.  You know a woman who has been hurt by this attitude, guaranteed.  You actually think you don't also know the someone who has hurt a woman this way?  Do the math - it's not just some degenerate criminal that is a dark stranger somewhere else, it's one of your peers, or coworkers, classmates, brothers, fathers or sons...or you.)  

Well done, Gillette.  Thank you for helping to lead the way towards helping boys grow to be actual men, in stead of stuck in the sophomoric stages of immaturity and insecurity of the emotionally underdeveloped."

Now this gripe wouldn't be with that specific commercial (although it counts as part of it), it would be with the fact that all I ever hear is how men need to do better, and how men need to change. I feel like it has made many women think it is okay to behave however they want.. Example: my ex was emotionally abusive towards me. Unwilling to compromise. I was expected to treat her like a queen, while none of that love was returned. I think this is mostly a problem with my generation and younger. A ""crazy""(bash in your window when she's mad type of girl), emotionally abusive, not willing to compromise type of girl is kind of seem as normal. While if you're a man you better not let one foot get out of line or you're in trouble... To make it clear this isn't just based off of my own personal experiences, I have seen this in so many of my peers.
Now.. Am I against seeing a commercial about how men need to do better? No..
But where are the commercials for the women? Why can't we have commercials about how we need to do better as a society without targeting one specific gender.
I do think men are targeted a lot today, and I don't think it's good."

,1552.0,0,2019-01-20T22:02:26Z,"@Plastered Spyro #1. The mindset that men and women cannot be friends, that any relationship with the opposite sex has to be always sexual in nature, this is what feminists consider this part as some sort of objectification, I don't agree with feminists on many things, but there is a point to it.  I mean, is like saying gay men cannot be friends with other men, does that make sense?

Ok, I get that from urbandictionary, I know it isn't an academic source, but for the sake of illustrating is quite useful, which are pretty good points. 

And well, is not surprising that someone with this mindset ending up sexual harassing a woman,  I'm not saying is always like that, but I can see where that may come from in some cases.

2.  Yes, there are men and women that have a high sex drive, the problem is the mindset that men, naturally, all of them, always want  sex, and they must, and if you don't,  *what's wrong with you?* <-- That I believe is the problem.

3. It's not funny, sexual abuse against men by men, is nothing to laugh about, and is as bad as sexual abuse against women, or worse, if  you get the social pressure that you are not suppose to come forward against it or that you are less of a man because you were not able to beat up the other man or men, that's the problem.  It seems that this is changing quite a bit in western society, which is a good thing.  But that mindset is not right, and it conforms with the idea of what 'toxic masculinity' is said to be,  it originates from the idea of how men are suppose to be men, even if some women laugh at them too. 

Also, men can be victims of violence from women, are they not men enough because of this?

4. It might be different nowadays, but I believe there is still shame against house husbands.

5. It means being sensitive, when you are moved by something really nice or beautiful and you cry, when someone hurt your feelings and you get tears in your eyes, like a broken heart for example, being hysterical or crying because you lose your necklace, that's another issue.   If you think that showing these things, like in the two previous examples, makes a man a pussy, well...., need I say more?

What I'm saying is that characteristics attributed to ""toxic masculinity"" really exist such as these, and I know that not all men are like that.   I don't fully agree with the ad, I'm against accusations being believed without the scrutiny of evidence, I'm against censorship because of political correctness, and I'm against the generalization that all men are bad."

Then it encourages other guys and boys to step in when they see this stuff and try to stop it or prevent it.  Still pretty legit so far.  

What is so offensive about this ad?  Be a good person offends you?  What kind of pieces of shit are all of you people that are so enraged you comment that you're going to boycott Gillette?  Why you mad?  I have a beard.  I use beard trimmers.  I've never in my life used razors to shave my face.  This ad wasn't even about razors though.  It was not-so-subliminal messaging to not stand by in this world and allow bad shit to happen on your watch.  That isn't a bad thing.  When my friends are acting like dicks, my cringe meter goes crazy and I HAVE to tell them to chill out and be civil.  I don't need an ad to tell me this.  But a lot of you don't want anyone to tell you to be cool.  You're all cool with people being bullied, or racist, or doing shit that harms other people.  You have no empathy.  You're psychos.  That's why this ad triggers you.  You claim you don't need a company telling you how to act.  I don't either.  But the difference is, it makes you angry.  You're full.of rage.  I don't need them to tell me how to act but the messaging doesn't infuriate me.   I agree with it.  I'm not a pyscho.  Don't be a psycho."

Wtf he just looked at this girl and thought she's an attractive woman I want to say hello that's how most humans function thus person. Is appealing to me I will go over and converse with them. I mean if you see the guy pull out his phone and start snapping pictures of her ass then ya boom get in there not cool bro but it wasn't like that and he didn't do anything. Then the next is the scene where two kids start fighting and all the guys say boys will be boys who the fuck in this day and age would get involved with someone else's kids they would be more likely to be called child molesters then a hero it's the parents responsibility to take care of there kids not me a stranger just walking by and I've never seen a woman step in either to break up a fight unless they are the kids parent. Don't touch other people's kids it's a sure fire way to get arrested especially for a man they see a man do it and everyone freaks out they see a woman do it and they think she's the mother.

You don't have to be asexual to know how to approach a woman properly. After I hear a woman speak passionately about what she LOVES, and that happens to be what I LOVE, now THERE's a reason to approach her!

You live in the real world where things dont conform to your worldview 99% of the time.

Yes men have a large amount of their life dictated by their cock. And far more dictated by ambition. But as i see, asexuals are not the top of womens attractiveness charts.

What you say is a brutish man is literally a stereotype you use to judge a category. Lets just make a bad stereptype and call it bad. No one disagrees that bad people are bad. Do you really believe people are defending insulting or stupid behavior? No.

The add is purposefully insulting, half of it atleast. Men should by all means continue to approach and talk to women they do not know in order to get to know them. How else are friendships or relationships formed, magic?

It means that your entire body moves according the whim of your penis. That's not the kind of man I expect to live alongside me in a dignified civilization. No wonder sitcoms and society make fun of the ""dumb husband"". He's real.

,1590.0,0,2019-01-20T18:23:51Z,"@Cosmic Vantage lol no, first there is nothing wrong with being attracted to attractive women. Second, since when was masculine desire shameful? Women love mens attention when its expressed well and responsive to her states. Its normal to want to talk with someone you can see a possibility of having a good time with and it takes courage to do so.

Most men are deadly afraid anyways and hold back because of approach anxiety. Most women would feel very complemented if a guy approached with warm intentions.

Sex doesnt happen in a vacuum, and women do like one night stands as well as men just under different conditions. He has to make her feel like a woman, trigger her desire and know to pull back and walk away if nothing will happen because women can smell desperation from a mile away.

Its the same with sexy women approaching you in your fantasies. The more natural and energizing and fun the conversation, the more you want to spend time and if they are sexy, hell you would be tempted even if you had a partner.

This is real life, for every asshole harassing a woman, there are hundreds more who give complements, warm greetings ect that go totally unnoticed but are appreciated even if they have a desire for more because the woman compartmentalizes the experiences differently.

On one hand some experiences are creepy, others are just nice or friendly with both being put in totally different parts of her mind.

End result is selective memory and bullshit like this. Some catcalling is very rude and obtrusive. Much like the lectures of overly busybodied women. However to categorically claim implicitly that approaching with sexual intentions is bad is to directly shame the male sexual mode of operation.

Its like claiming we should lock women in houses forever because dangers exist outside. Its overly protective hyperexaggerated garbage which is turned against men instead of for women.

We should treat eachother with respect and it would be nice if all men knew implicitly how to conduct themselves with women. But thats an impossible standard because nothing is actually put in place to make this transformation authentic and in harmony with masculine identity. Far less considering natural differences in upbringing and family values.

If approaching was wrong i wouldnt have had any girlfriends and i can say it took a hell of a lot of courage to get passed my fear of approach anxiety."

By making them more and more scared of their surroundings by playing the same propaganda all day long that all men are rapists , sexists etc they get in a defensive mode where they just avoid everything that has to do with men. One can't live without the other and the society collapses.

Maybe you saw this somewhere else or from somewhere else but that doesn't have to do with what I said in the first comment. By targeting the 50% of the population with phycological methods and make them insecure about the world and reality itself, 100% of the population suffers. This method is relatively cheap because they use words rather than weapons (which require development etc) to weaken an enemy. Those types of methods where used for thousands of years but now they are using women as a weapon by making them insecure which leads to destruction in every aspect of life and yes even threatens the existence of humans in the future (because obviously the only ones who can create humans are females). The same thing happens when the ant of bee queens feel threatened and not safe, they spread out Stress hormones which irritates the whole colony and they eventually lose track of what is going on and vanish. Proven tactics"
,1627.0,0,2019-01-21T03:11:58Z,"@Scarlett Cunningham As I said, you are acting out of feelings. You had a bad experience in your life which triggered the defense mechanism that nature gave to all organisms (especially strong in female parts of living things because they protect their offsprings with their lives [part of the mother instinct]) so you generalize a whole group of humans for being something that a small but very violent minority does to women all around the world for thousands of years. We as humans evolved out of this and created something called the police and laws which strengthen the logic of not harming others and stabilize the morality of living in the same world and cooperate for a better future for all. I could use the word sexism against those bombs that you drop on every male part for being the most aggressive and most violent half of humanity but you clearly don't know (or know pretty well and use it right now yourself) the way men and women use violence. Statically men have more muscle mass (cause of the higher testosterone levels) which makes them be more fit for physical violence, on the other hand female on average have more complex neuron connections in their brains which makes them fit for phycological violence. You can't see the the phycological violence as clear as the physical one, that is what makes you think that women are less violent. Everyone has the potential to be violent, but everyone uses different methods to be violent according to his strengths and weaknesses. Moral, logic and feelings hold us back but can be also the triggers for being violent. We have it in our DNA , it's mostly used as defense but we can choose to use it in an offensive way to gain advantage from other humans."

,1630.0,0,2019-01-20T17:54:42Z,"@Scarlett Cunningham The main issue, at least in the US, is how the divorce courts have often become overly women-friendly, even when they're the ones cheating, and the men aren't being abusive. I've heard horror stories about how prenups get thrown out, how women get most of the financial assets, and big alimony/child support, even if the husbands can prove malfeasance by the wives. The judges often don't care. I don't know if that's Marxist-influenced, but I'd pretty hesitant to get married these days.

Of course there are often dangerous encounters with men, and toxic masculinity in general, but that's a different matter, altogether from what's going on in divorce courts. If the two are linked, it's overreaction on the part of the family court system."

Listen it's not complicated. It's very simply saying that we should try to be the best people that we can, and part of that is speaking up when we see an injustice happening.

It does not indicate what type of behavior is toxic. It isn't a type of behavior that everyone engages in. It is a specifically male coded type of bad behavior (which doesn't mean non-males don't do it, to be clear).

Your words are contradictory. You pretend as if the ""language such that the actions of the minority are synonymous with the entire male sex"" yet you earlier quote them as saying ""some...but some isn't enough."" Some is non-all."

And if you want to go the PC route, a less polarizing term would be toxic humanity or simply toxic behavior because ANYONE is capable of the crimes discribed in that commercial. Perhaps people wouldn't be throwing such a conniption fit had Gillette chosen not to portray most men as either condoning, perpetuating or participating in the quote on quote ""rape culture"". What's worse is that it claims that most men are teaching their children that such behaviour is acceptable. I appreciate you being respectful in your response, and because you strike me as one who believes that BOTH words and context matter, I would like you to think about this. 

If Gillette does not believe that toxic behaviour is an inherent trait in the majority of the male sex, then why does the commercial only say ""some men...but some isn't enough""? 

If they are simply using the word ""toxic"" to emphasize a particular behavior that anyone is capable of, why single out associate entire group of people with it? 

Why is the language such that the actions of the minority are synonymous with the entire male sex, but the majority are ""bad fathers""?

Does that kind rhetoric strike you as historically fascist?

I strongly disagree with your assessment that those who take issue with this ad only do so because they are defending, accepting, condoning of, guilty of said attitudes and crimes or otherwise. That's a baseless claim that I've heard from many people. It's called arguing from ignorance and using a strawman tactic."

As a qualifier it separates into two groups, those who are toxic and those who are not. This applies to the other categories you've introduced. I think saying that, for instance, ISIS is ""toxic Islam"" is a fairly politically correct way to actually differentiate between the bad kind and the non-toxic kind. One could see a similar take on comparing your standard old atheist to a toxic militant atheist proselytizer or a toxic Christian who sees himself as holier than thou as compared to a St Francis type. 

When people are upset about it, they're probably of the toxic kind, rather than the non-toxic kind."

The reason why communism doesn't work is no human gives up that power once they have it.

If you are out protesting something and shouting with a loudspeaker and I come up to you to oppose your views and call you an idiot it isn't harassment, you are in a public place sharing your views therefore so do others.

Example, cat calling ... very few men actually cat call and mostly those who do are stupid teenages/kids (all teenagers and kids are stupid, including myself at that age ... I thought I knew everything but I actually knew nothing) ... some girls I know like cat calling and actually got into a relationship because they like compliments and like the fact the men had the balls to do it, then I again I know women who are the complete opposite. This is the whole point, you can't ever say anything defiantly because two things are almost never the same. Generalizing anything is more bigoted than anything else as no two situations are ever the same. This is why if people could actually talk to each other without animosity this shit would probably stop but people don't because they have to always have to go to extremes. This is the same with politics, I don't like my leader or trump but people calling for their deaths are tools, not democratic and their is ways to get them removed democratically but they don't which goes back to ""actions matter more than words"". No two situations are the same as no two people are truly the same so why be an idiotic ahole and generalize (I know I said that like 3 times but seriously)."
,1704.0,0,2019-01-20T13:22:54Z,"@Microtransaction Harassing is any behaviour which violates personal boundaries of individual and seeks to subordinate and coerce them into doing activities against their will. Those rom coms are prominent examples of how harassment is taught to be normalized in our culture. While what constitutes boundary violation to a person can vary according to individual, the notion of harassment as an action which violates personal boundaries regardless of what those said boundaries are defined by is not a matter of opinion. If someone is having their physical space violated according to their predefined standards, that is harassment. For the majority of women, catcalling is a form of harassment because its an objectifying behaviour that exists on a continuum of behaviours include stalking, groping and ultimately rape. Any action that seeks to dehumanize another person is not entirely a matter of opinion."
,1705.0,0,2019-01-20T12:53:17Z,"@ex_orpheus Okay, but what constitutes harassment because last time I checked every single rom com the men seem to ""harass"" the women to date them ... showing up and breaking up weddings/marriages is a prime example of that. The real truth is there is no toxic masculinity or toxic femininity just stupid people with a difference of opinion. If you don't like people having their own opinions and personalities go live in a place like North Korea with no freedom as some corrupt douche tell you what you should think ... hmmm ironically like these people who made the Gillette ad lol. (Stupidly because of the idiotic times we live in I feel like I have to say I do not condone or support any asshole actions so my message box doesn't blow up with people saying I condone rape or murder, the whole point is it is a small amount of the population [men and women] that is actually toxic [rape, murder, etc. not people being  offended because they are snowflakes which I hate trump but that is a good word to use]). Freedom is being able to have your own opinions; however, freedom is only freedom if you don't step on the freedom of others ... example: You can hold the opinion of not liking homosexuals as that is your right, what you can't do is refuse them service or abuse them just because they are homosexual."

That's literally what the ad is creating, a guy trying to talk with a girl in a flirting manner, boys wrestling and its called toxic masculinity, but things  like women doing character assassinations isn't?

You're yet to show me one ad on toxic femininity, which uses words linked only to the female gender in order to describe somethings negative. - This was my main point from the start but YOU went do the rabbit hole.

And this ad is far left politics which isn't fact. Its made up feminist canon, its not fact. For toxic masculinity to  exist the existence of the patriarchy and all other feminist dogmas must also be accepted as truth, since toxic masculinity was created by the feminists and it is a symptom of the patriarchy.

But hey lets not call it stop bullying, stop sexual abuse etc. Lets link it to a sex. Thats the crux what everyone is mad about.

 And the ""boys will be boys"" is famously used by the feminists where they created a false fantasy. They say its very common for people to say boys will be boys when rape occurs etc. You seem to not know anything about the finer nuances and simply strawman the ad as ""be a nice person"" which it is not.

The ad was literally created by a far left feminist, but keep telling me how this is counter productive to their movement? Nice contradiction."

The ad isnt saying stop being masculine its saying to work on changing the narrow and repressive definition of manhood. If you think this is an attack on all men I assume you must hate men to think we all fit in this narrow definition of masculinity. If this is far left leaning then you are somewhat saying that the right is okay with shithead males which I do not approve of. Also I will mention again why you unnecessarily moved the goalpost of the argument into something more narrower for literally no reason than to say you are right. Toxic femininity appears in hundreds of commercials but you and I both know that toxic femininity is no where near as destructive or normalized as toxic masculinity. Women are much more likely to get ads that say be yourself and you're already perfect how you are that they have less need to conform to toxic femininity. Men also get similar ads but it's never been as ham fisted as this one that's why everyone's panties are in a bunch.

What in the fuck are you guys upset about? This is just an ad from a huge corporation which addresses some age old problems in the way some men view and treat women. 

If you didn't perceive yourself as being one of the people this ad targets, then you wouldn't even give it a second thought. You'd probably even go as far as to view it in a positive light, and feel it might be what some guys need to decide to make a positive change within themselves... Why is that bad in any way?

I'm actually quite disheartened by the level of outrage and negativity in this comment section... Somehow, of the two-hundred or so comments I scanned, I saw nothing else. Every last comment was negative... with most voicing their opposition quite emphatically. I had no idea this culture was still so prevalent. I honestly thought most men had rounded the corner of misogyny and abuse, but it appears that I was a bit out of the proverbial loop on this topic.

Bottom line. If you're outraged over something as innocuous as this ad, then you take issue with the message it delivers. Why would you ever take issue with the respectful treatment of women? I knew this issue was far from being eradicated from society, but to see so many men and even women becoming so outraged over something which, in my opinion, delivers a message which is exceedingly positive and provides hope for a better tomorrow, is definitely an eye opener.

I'd like to close by informing everyone who is outraged over this ad of just one thing... YOU are a part of a much bigger problem. A problem which has caused more needless emotional and physical pain than any war ever has. Please take some time to evaluate the anger you are currently experiencing. There is absolutely no valid or rational reason for you to be upset over this ad. The fact you are should be more than just a little concerning... Not only to others, but to yourselves as well. 

The culture you're all defending so vehemently is the mistreatment of women. Don't try and disguise it as being something else, because that is precisely what it is. Fuck off with that weak, insecure bullshit... Stand up for masculinity by actually acting like a man... Not like some spoiled child, experiencing the various inconveniences which inevitably come with our first taste of responsibility. We all should eagerly accept the responsibility that is showing everyone the same level of respect we expect to receive ourselves. Those who have chosen to shirk or ignore this seemingly simple gesture are directly responsible for a truly unbelievable amount of human suffering and injustice.  

Real men don't mistreat women, or anyone else for that matter. Self-improvement can only be achieved through one's invested efforts into themselves, and never through the senseless tearing down of others. While diminishing others might cause you to feel somehow better at that moment, such feelings are nothing more than an temporary illusion. You haven't actually improved, or achieved anything. You've simply become yet another cog in an extremely problematic machine."

2972.0,,0,2019-01-19T15:17:45Z,"Well‚Ä¶..okay then‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. I think we need a tampon commercial for ‚ÄúToxic Femininity.‚Äù

Let‚Äôs start with dependence on the welfare state, entitlement to men's labor,
paternity fraud, false rape allegations, passive aggression and proxy violence,
misandry, empowerment through victimization, hypo agency, hypergamy, gold-digging,
overestimation of sexual marketplace value, sexual manipulation to achieve
goals, seduction of minors, unresolved daddy issues, neuroticism, emotional
impulsivity, emotional abuse, henpecking, gossiping and backstabbing as
conflict avoidance, green-eyed monsters, entitlement mentality, wanting the
power of men, the privilege of being a woman, and the responsibility of neither.

Toxic Femininity is when a woman tricks a man into raising a child that isn't his.

Toxic Femininity is when a woman lies about physical or emotional abuse in court to
gain custody of the children.

Toxic Femininity
is when a woman marries a man only for his money.

Toxic Femininity
is when a mother says bad things to her child about the father behind his back.

Toxic Femininity
is when a woman makes a false claim of sexual assault.

Toxic Femininity
is when women use social media to cyberbully boys into believing their gender
is inherently evil.

Toxic Femininity
is when women expect a man to pay for everything.

Toxic Femininity
is when a woman hits a man and expects to get away with it because she's a
woman.

Toxic Femininity
is when female teachers give better grades to female students, just because
they are girls.

Toxic Femininity
is when women shut down the conversation about male homelessness and suicide
because it doesn't fit their narrative.

Toxic Femininity
is when women say, ""the future is female"" right in the face of their
sons.

This is what Toxic Femininity looks like.

Did that make you feel uncomfortable? Did you feel like that was a little bit of an
over-generalization?

Good. Now you know how most men felt when they saw that Gillette ad.

Now let's talk about P&Gs child labor practices, do you think this will be
detrimental to their health in the future. Do you think the toxic chemicals in
there cleaning products could have long term effects on humans and their children?
These might be some of the real topics we need to be discussing."

At 0:56 in the original ad, a white male says ""Hello sweetie"" to a woman, and a black male just comes in and blocks him as if he was about to commit some shit. Another example is 1:03 where a woman walks past a white male, the same male then becomes interested in the woman and wants to confront her; but, another black male intervenes saying ""Not cool, not cool"". Both parts of these examples in the ad show no context as to what was bad about these men wanting to talk to these girls."

But heaven forbid people take issue with an add that INTENTIONALLY targeted a group based on gender and committed gross stereotyping as well as shaming (aka discrimination) against said group as though ""all people of that group were the same"" (aka discrimination, possibly also prejudice). Feel free to check Merriam-Webster definitions so you know I used them accurately (prejudice is a loose fit, but I feel the negative intent of the add makes it appropriate).

Interesting that as a social worker these are some of the very things I struggle to help eliminate FOR EVERYONE daily, both professionally and personally as a volunteer. Yet I see so many people who claim out of one side of their mouth to want these things to end speak out of the other side to commit the very  same behavior toward the new socially approved races and gender. There was a time where it was socially accepted to publicly speak negatively about people of color, and those people doing it didn't not feel as if they were  in the wrong because it was socially acceptable. Too many people claiming to work against  this behavior are actually perpetuating it, and just picking the new socially accepted target; this makes them no less bigotted than those who targeted people of color in my opinion."

The entire Venus brand is under the Gillette umbrella and it sucks (at least for me). I fully understand making women's razors with the girly color scheme --not going to lie, I love the cutesy stuff as much as any girl-- but their women's line is just plain inferior. So it's hypocritical of them to jump on the feminist, ""woke"" bandwagon, when they don't stock a 5-blade in most stores. Their advert is inconsistent with their own company policy. They are as ""woke"" as they think they need to be to make more sales-- funnily enough they seem to have upset enough people that I doubt this ad will improve revenue. Even as someone who learned how to shave with the men's Gillette Fusion, I'm not entirely sure if I'll re-purchase once that time comes. Schick Hydro 5 is pretty good too."

Just because some women do great things doesn‚Äôt mean you get to emotionally manipulate people and be goldiggers. We can play the tit for tat game all day.

It‚Äôs just interesting most of the things you use on a daily basis were invented by men. 

Most of the conveniences you have in your life  were made by enterprising, competitive, determined men. 

It‚Äôs funny that now you get to try and convince me that men are more defective than women using the very devices that these toxic men have created. 

The point is the preaching about how men can improve is rarely offset with any openness for self improvement on the part of the woman.  This one-sided view of society‚Äôs issues has clearly gone on too long and is starting to annoy more and more guys.  Oh and masculinity can only be considered ‚Äútoxic‚Äù based on the setting. 

I guarantee if there were saber tooth tigers running around you‚Äôd find yourself the most toxically masculine dude in town.

(she is a talented director - I just do not agree that she was the most appropriate director for a mans advert considering her personal views). All she has done in insult alll of the good men that ARE already doing this. By say men are toxic but ‚Äòsome‚Äô are not.  This is not how you win friends and influence people.  Sorry Gillette, you got the messaging wrong.  Men are great but and men can be more would have worked.  This FAILED.  ALL IT DID WAS CREATE A DIVIDE.  I am still going to continue to be a model man regardless of your opinion of me that I am toxic.  F.u. Gillette.  So thanks for the years of razors, but I am changing brands in my next purchase."

The problem was, they put it as ""all men need to try harder"" not as ""some men are good examples already, while some should try to follow their example""
The whole narrative was underlining the idea that all men are flawed by nature and need to work hard to overcome that. That's the insulting part about it.

If I made an ad that Women should try their best not to dress like sluts as their nature wants them to, I'd get PC shit all over me. Make an ad that basically suggests that men have an inherit need to work on improving themselves to be sufficient to society, and no one is allowed to have any criticism?  How stupid is that?

And those comments made by a company that sells razors. As if shaving your face was the main identifying factor of being a real man. As if they are any moral authority on what men should be like, while they've been the ones artificially feeding the manly-men meme for decades now.

I was responding to the reactionary stance where men are emasculated for having traditionally feminist values. It's a joke, ok, but it reveals how you feel about other men, and these traits are the ones seen as toxic. That's all I'm saying: that's the behavior that is being challenged, and you're responding directly with it. Likewise, its being a joke doesnt disqualify me from responding to it and what it says about our perceptions of masculinity.

,1931.0,0,2019-01-19T16:44:15Z,"The only parts of masculinity deemed ""toxic"" are those which categorize a portion of males as ""not real males (soyboys)"". The idea is that masculinity can be represented in a variety of ways, and it's unhealthy to shame men for not being traditionally masculine, especially young boys. Agree or disagree, that's perhaps the most level-headed description of the argument.

 Btw you can keep muscles, beards, and love for cars etc while being non toxic. U can still be a man lol. Violence is a largely male trend, as well as suicide. This kind of promotion is (even if mishandled in this particular instance) is aimed to make men better for their own sake, and not just womens'. 

But I have a more personal question for you. What does calling someone soyboy do for you? What do your muscles or beard (or whatever metric you're using to define masculinity) give you that makes you superior to the others?"

So liberals are more willing to accept that people hold opinions they personally do not share than people on the right.
What you consider them agreeing is in reality just them accepting that each individual has a right to weird opinions. 

The same people that you now accuse of sharing these views because they don't oppose are the people that also do not oppose to you voicing your opinion, without them getting the benefit of the doubt that they are on your side then. 

Know that a majority of people are not those weird liberals, just like the people in the middle know that the majority of right-wingers aren't white-pride nationalists who want to make every brown person on earth suffer for being inferior. It's a couple brainless people on both sides that dominate the discussion. Make sure you focus on what you think not on what they tell you the other side believes.

,1977.0,0,2019-01-19T22:37:31Z,"@MastersMasterson As  for your first point: 3rd wave feminism is not classic feminism, and I based my argument upon the causes thay 3rd wave feminists stand for.
Classic feminism on the other hand, has fairly accomplished its mission, it is time now for egalitarianism, modern egalitarianism. I can't see why would our society still need feminism in the presence of an egalitarian social structure.

For your second argument: sex is not always clean cut neither, cases of hermaphrodites occur, in such case, problems which gender identity can be explained biologically.
If an individual is raised in a way that does not much their sex, that my lead to gender identity problems too, meaning that problems with gender identity can also be explained by social factors (the one mentioned above or other ones)
Now, if an individual is born as a male (e.g) and raised and treated as one, and identifies as a female. That is considered a gender identity problem as well because what this person identifies as does not match his body. In this case, the problem is caused by intrinsic psychological factors, which means the presence of a disorder that should be treated. The problem resides within this person's perception of one's self, not within his body. 
Gender identity is correlated with the sex and with the social experiences of an individual. It is defined internally, but the fallacy here is to say that this means that one can define as whatever they feel like being. That means that G. Identity being internally defined means that a person can identify its gender in linkage with her/his body structure and with her/his environment."

,1979.0,0,2019-01-19T21:53:29Z,"@MastersMasterson Wrong interpretation there, it is not the gender, it is the ideology, the agenda that is being pushed.Adopting 3rd wave feminism instead of egalitarianism based on science (sociology,physiology, psychology) and strong laws and regulations, is a mistake that might have utterly severe repercussions in the future. If emotions are accounted for more than facts, and if people can now just say ""fuck you"" to factual evidence because they are offended by it, then we're in deep trouble. Little examples: gender quotas in certain cases, free the nipples, ""gender dysphoria"" becoming politically incorrect to mention. 
Therefore, this is not about the fact that she's a female but more about the fact that she calls herself a ""feminist"" in 2019.

Some of us know how to be a positive male role model without trashing masculine traits, but a lot of men don't know the difference between being comfortable in your masculinity and treating it like its the only truth there is. ""Boys will be boys"" kicked my ass growing up, and a lot of people have comitted suicide or live with depression and anxiety because someone's pride went unchecked by their peers. The idea of toxic masculinity isn't to call all masculinity toxic, its to separate the boys from the men, literally. Not all masculinity is toxic, just like not all feminism is bull shit. Basically the Gillette ad said they see the best in men, and want to inspire us to be better to each other. Is Terry Crews not an excellent example of what this means? What about the other man that stopped the 2 kids from fighting and showed them all that they should treat each other with respect? What about the guy encouraging his daugher in the mirror?

,2003.0,0,2019-01-21T04:47:49Z,"@B R You're draeing a false equivalency between abusive men/ men passive in the face of abuse and Islamic terrorists. An advertisement condemning the majority of muslims for being terrororist would be extremely inaccurate, and an ad calling a majority of women gold diggers/ false rape accusors would also be inaccurate. Those are two really bad examples at trying to draw a parallel, but if there were similar advertisements that say, encouraged the positive members of these groups (women/ muslims) to be more vocal in condemning the worst of their group, then I'm sure there'd still be outrage because people don't like to be called to task. I personally don't see an issue with advertisemnts like that, and I wish more companies would be brave enough to take a stand on issues like that. 

Grilling is not masculine, thats absurd. A good example of what people call toxic masculinity is making things like grilling a rite of passage to/ evidence of one's masculinity, when nothing about throwing meat on a grill makes somebody masculine. My mother like to barbecue and does often. My father doesn't and neither do I. My mother is not a masculine woman and neither me or my father are feminine men. Liking football isn't masculine either, and neither is hunting. Another indicator of masculinity being perverted into toxicity is when people say things like ""fighting is masculine"" No. Fighting WITH CAUSE is masculine. Fighting without reason is toxic. The boys in the ad were fighting without a real cause. My proof? They're kids, what the fuck could they possibly be fighting over? Its a real man's responsibility to teach younger men to settle disputes with peace until that's no longer an option. My father is an MMA fighter, and I damn near learned to walk in a boxing gym and spent my early childhood training Muay Thai and BJJ in a gym mostly occupied by professional fighters and police officers, some of the most masculine and strong willed men anyone could hope to meet. NOT ONE of them would resort to violence without exercising every other option first, and not one of them lets their children fight without a reason to either. Toxic masculinity is when things like ""Men fight"" get taken too far. Masculinity is leadership, **not controlling people** . Masculinity is confidence, **not unwavering pride** . Masculinity is charisma, **not manipulation** . And more pertinent to the topic at hand, masculinity is conviction and being able to make sacrifices for your beliefs, **NOT RESORTING TO VIOLENCE AS SOON AS IT BECOMES AN OPTION, LIKE AN UNINFORMED CHILD WOULD DO BEFORE A RESPONSIBLE ADULT STEPS IN TO EDUCATE THEM ABOUT THIS** .

The unending line doesn't have to represent that all men hold these beliefs, it represents that a majority either do or find a reason not to be vocal against it. These men all sat passively while watching 2 kids fighting over some obviously dumb shit saying ""Boys will be boys"" You can't really believe that this is a minority of men, when you yourself are more or less saying that this is what men should do in this situation. Look at the outrage because of this ad. Look how many people feel as if they're being mocked by an ad meant to inspire men to take a stand against abuse and toxicity. Men are separate from abuse and toxicity, that is not what we are. What the Gilette ad showcased was what these things look like on men more often than not. If you don't see yourself as the man stepping forward in these situations, but also don't identify as a perpetrator or enabler of abuse then why do you feel insulted? Do you really think that abuse and toxicity are so inseparable from human males so much that an advertisement calling them out has to be an attack on our entire sex? I doubt it, but thats how you're making youself sound. Again, I don't wanna keep checking back to stress over whether I'm putting things properly or misrepresenting my beliefs because of my lack of proficiency when it comes to making an argument, so I'm gonna reccomend Beau of the Fifth Column again. He's an excellent speaker and will do a much better job of helping you understand where I and many others are coming from than I can"
,2004.0,0,2019-01-20T19:13:18Z,"@B R I'm gonna have to ask again that you back up your claim by using logic and reasoning, not by saying ""look at it, the answer is clear to us all, just think about it"" I've looked at it. I keep looking at it, and based on the reasoning I provided I reached a different conclusion. If your only logic is ""just look at it"" then I was right, you *are* an ideologue and you're wasting everyone's time by sharing your opinion. So far all you've done is talk in circles and say the ad is full of contempt for men without explaining yourself. Also, you only addressed the very first argument I made, you left 2 or 3 more hanging.

Also I feel the need to add, I don't feel attacked or even vaguely disrespected by the advertisement. I don't identify at all with the men being mocked, I identify with the men stepping forward, which made me feel congratulated. It helped me feel motivated to continue to try and make the world a better place for myself, those around me, and the next generation of young men. I don't feel like I enable abuse, I do what I can to combat it, so I felt like I was being thanked. Its a shame more men don't feel that way, and its proof of why the ad is important."
,2005.0,0,2019-01-20T05:41:07Z,"@B R Also, anecdotal evidence about what ""isn't unusual"" isn't enough to drive a point home. Things like the negative examples shown in the ad happened somewhat often in my life but I know better than to try and convince someone online thay my experience is valid. I'm not great with words, but if you really want to challenge your thinking, look for Beau of the Fifth Column here on YouTube, he's a very wise and intelligent man, and we have a common philosophy om this topic, he should be able to echo my sentiment better than I put it in the first place"
,2006.0,0,2019-01-20T05:06:19Z,"@B R That scene isn't meant to be taken as realistic, its symbolic. Furthermore, saying ""If you don't agree, you aren't paying attention"" doesn't count as using logical reasoning and makes you look like an ideologue. The ad did encourage men to be our best, if I remember correctly it literally said ""We see the best in men"" and the title is ""We Believe: The Best Men Can Be"" is standing up for victims without power and inspiring those around you to do the same not something all men should aspire to do? Many men (no one ever said all) either perpetuate this negative behavior or do nothing to stop it, often making excuses for why they don't. ""Boys will be boys"" creates a narrative that men are by nature doomed to ruin all we touch and people should knoe better than to think that we can change. I, the creators of this advertisement and millions of other men think its time we tear this narrative down. Like Terry Crews said, men need to hold other men accountable. Either he's talking to you or about you, the choice is yours my friend."
,2007.0,0,2019-01-20T04:27:39Z,"@B R oh right, sure I think boys act more maculinly doing things like grilling but I think it's also obvious that boys are indeed given more leeway in the generalisation that boys will be boys, no? Whereas girls are told to be lady like therefore not reaching those levels that might be considered ""toxic""."

Meanwhile he is getting a standing ovation at the freaking Oscars. Guess the whole believe women thing doesn't apply to a 13 year old girl. if you go back and look at everyone who gave the standing ovation.

And enough of constantly cucking to the left's framing. They don't give a shit about equality. They never cared. It was all about how much hatred of you they could get away with.

I hate the SJW's but they're right about one thing: anti-SJW's are triggered snowflakes. All you do is complain rather than addressing deeper issues. They make commercials like this and LAUGH at you knowing that the disproportionately white male audience will be a small minority in a few decades. They're spitting in your faces and laughing. Get woke go broke? No. Nike just had a bump in the road. They'll gladly make up the lost bump in money somewhere else. It's not about money - it's about propaganda and they pay no price for it.

But hey this fencesitting burnout will still make cash and play the ""Big-brained Centrist"" angle and get rich. Just keep spamming whiny anti-SJW videos as your opponents cackle at your coming death and your impotent rage. Or you can get off this shit.

‚ÄúThis product is 400% more likely to slice your face open than a regular razor, but you can take it because you‚Äôre not a pussy,‚Äù explained the three minute Schick Alpha Male Razor commercial. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a razor for a man who refuses to be told what to do by a woman, whether she‚Äôs running for president or a doctor trying to stitch up his bleeding face.‚Äù
Special ‚Äúgay-preventing grips‚Äù along the shaft are specially designed to reduce the razor from being dropped in the shower. The hyper-masculine shaving product is four times larger than a typical blade ‚Äúso no one will fuck with it,‚Äù says the ad.
Instructions on the back of the packaging spell out a cruel and humiliating self-hazing ritual that must be completed before using the Alpha Male Razor.
‚ÄúThe blade only works on men with real jobs since women wouldn‚Äôt know how it works.‚Äù
To top it all off, the blade comes with a built-in speaker which plays Jordan Peterson reading from his books to smoothly affirm pre-existing prejudices.
In related news, a special hotline has been set up by Piers Morgan to help all of the men who feel that they were oppressed by Gillette‚Äôs commercial.

This event however is estimated to take approximately 4.6 million years but in the 3.5 billion years that humans have inhabited the earth that is a blink of an eye.  Look into it.

3494.0,,0,2019-01-18T23:37:10Z,"""Toxic masculinity"" is misandric just as 'toxic femininity"" is misogynistic. It's saying an aspect of masculinity is toxic not that there are pseuo-masculine traits that need changed. Basic basic english comprehension here, you're either a moron or willfully ignorant if you think the term isn't sexist. So that's a problem.

When they show a man being shutdown from approaching a woman it is not conveyed that he was going to harass her, catcall her, or otherwise be a dick. He was just approaching her and the other guy assumed the worst of him for being a man, aka, being sexist. This was a matter of poor conveyance, they could've shown him cat calling and get shutdown and there would be no confusion about this. As it is, it seems to suggest even approaching a woman is harassment which is nonsense. So that's a problem.

The boys fight getting broken up. Boys fight, get over it! It's not society, it's not western culture, it's literally just how boys act at that age.  Those two boys are going to be major bully targets by being told they can not defend themselves. It's basically just feminists failing to understand child psychology. So that's a problem.

The rest was cringey nonsense from a corporation obviously just marketing to wimps. So that's a problem, companies stop doing this shit. You don't get to act superior morally you're not Costco you're a greedy soulless company that gladly supports legislation keeping poor people poor or poorer."

It was no accident this commercial was produced in a manner many men may find offensive. This no doubt was a marketing strategy aimed at reeling in more females to buy their products.  Rather than directing a campaign for the female product line they created a commercial heavy on the social justice virtue signaling appearing to be directed at males.  This was no doubt done knowing there would be throwback from male customers, triggering the #metoo movement to make the case for toxic men offended by a commercial promoting goodness.  

The owners knew this campaign would pick up more views and more steam trending on social media than it possibly could as a ladies razor commercial airing daily on television.   Sound about right?  

Females in numbers are still shaving their legs, under their arms as well as more personal places.  This marketing strategy is aimed at them. The rational? No big deal if you lose offended male customers because they're not shaving anymore anyways.

Jerry: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not stupid, I‚Äôm looking right at the drawer.‚Äù  Her: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt say you were stupid!‚Äù  Jerry: ‚ÄúWell wouldn‚Äôt I have to be?‚Äù

This is the conceit of the commercial.  It‚Äôs calling me a sexist pig, and then when I object because I‚Äôm not a sexist pig, the response from our culture is saying I‚Äôm the problem because I *must* be a sexist pig, while Gillette is saying they never called me a sexist pig.  But wouldn‚Äôt I have to be if you assumed that I was and you felt you had to lecture me?  I‚Äôm damned either way, so yes I feel insulted and stereotyped by this commercial.  That‚Äôs the position this preachy commercial puts all men in, so I think the anger at it is justifiable.

You can‚Äôt show terrible examples of bad people doing asshole things in order to ask ‚Äòis this the best men can get?‚Äô without the assumptions that these behaviors are part of being a man, that men are currently no better than this, and that they *need* improvement or are not good enough as-is.  That assumption is deeply tied into this idea that the primary problem with rapists, abusers, harassers, etc is not that they‚Äôre assholes doing illegal shit but that they‚Äôre men.  I absolutely believe that it is sexist and wrong to assume that this ‚Äòtoxic masculinity‚Äô is part of being a man rather than a symptom of being a bad person."

,2147.0,0,2019-01-18T20:43:36Z,@Apurv Chaturvedi You're not wrong. People are getting backlash from this commercial sooo... clearly there will be negative crap from people no matter what. That shouldn't stop people from pushing good messages out there. There should be messages about women falsely accusing men of rape or sexual assault because it slows down the process and takes away the severity of the real cases. If people don't like the commercial then they should just ignore it and go about their day instead of being negative or hateful. It's a message to not sexually assault women....so there really shouldn't be an issue.
,2148.0,0,2019-01-18T20:38:33Z,"Rape is very bad.  But you know what else is equally bad ? Women who falsely accuse someone of rape. It happens 


Now imagine if a women only brand puts out an advertisement saying "" don't falsely accuse people of rape"" 

Even though they are doing a good thing and raising awareness , the company is bound to get backlash from women and feminists . Tell me I am wrong .

Women and especially feminists will be like "" How dare they ? This company is hindering women empowerment ? They think every women who reports rape is falsely accusing men "" and blah blah blah . 

That's what I want to bring to attention.  This Gillette ad might be aimed at the bad guys but is bound to make one feel ashamed of being a man even though he hasn't done anything wrong . It's generalising all men."

3665.0,,0,2019-01-18T18:13:32Z,"I'm concerned this could actually turn out well for P&G and that they are making a calculation that there are more feminist-influenced women and men who will support their overall product suite than the number of men who will actually be offended to the extent where there will be any effective boycott of their products or damage to their bottom line.  If the financial hit that P&G takes on their Gillette brand is less than any bump that they may get on their overall suite from ""progressive"" consumers, then they actually win.  This is extremely concerning as if that occurs, I guarantee there are a myriad of other ""left"" leaning corporations watching and waiting to pile on.  This could be just the beginning of the commercial attacks on so-called ""toxic masculinity"".   

Us men who are deeply offended by the insidious, toxic-feminist messaging in Gillette's commercial, we MUST boycott ALL Proctor & Gamble products, not just Gillette.  We need to be talking to other men and women of like mind to do the same.  I believe this point in time is a critical juncture.  As angry as so many of us are, we need to control and channel that anger into passion and action to sustain an effective campaign against the ""progressive"" infestation of our corporations - P&G is that target!!  Having worked for large corporations myself, I can tell you it's getting really bad.  Internal company blogs are filled with this progressive, feminist viewpoints on the oppression of women, minorities, etc, by men (most popularly straight, white men).  I've personally witnessed C-suite executives praise these women and messages as being courageous!  ""See something, Say something"" has become the Diversity & Inclusion corporate mantra, effectively establishing everyone (but men in particular) as potential boogeyman out to oppress anyone not like them.  The tone is clear and any expressing any counterpoint to the message will lead to the end of your career.  C-Suite white males have made calculations that their survival is based on furthering the feminist-activist agenda internally and are positioning themselves as ""allies"" of all the ""intersectionally"" oppressed.

I love women and I'm all for their EQUAL opportunity (outcome is a different thing).  I mostly appreciate diversity - I certainly am strongly opposed to racism.  I support many kinds of rights of people who aren't like me as a straight, white male.  However, I absolutely despise this sanctimonious ""progressive"" movement that is trying to force it's viewpoints down everyone else's throats and tries to justify it's means by blaming the shortcomings of the past, by painting men with the broad brush of ""toxic masculinity"".  

Now is the time - we must stand up as men!  Thank you Joe for being willing to take heat for your positions and not caving to the ""progressive"", Hollywood mindset."

Those issues however do not negate the importance of rape culture, the pay gap (which has been proven extensively) and the patriarchy. What you perceive to be innocuous behaviour is toxic behaviour that potentially escalates into violent behaviour. Western feminists are preventing us from becoming extremer versions of patriarchies as seen in places like Saudi Arabia. It's also not the onus of us Westerners to intervene with the affairs of other nations. The Vietnam War is a case in point, as are the recent wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Sidestepping to extremer forms of oppression in non-Western societies is also intellectually dishonest because you are falsely categorizing such as the pay gap and glass ceiling and the culture are 'lesser', when they are serious and immediate to a lot of women. This is called hijacking a conversation. Oppression which appears invisible or non-existent to you does not negate its experience. It is a well documented fact of reality that marginalized people experience life differently. Atomicized individualism does not exist."

As I mentioned before, hunter gatherer societies were egalitarian and still are egalitarian today. This has been verified by evolutionary psychology, archaeology and anthropology. Agriculture and domestication gave rise to private property, which ultimately gave rise to sedentary human settlements, which in turn gave rise to patriarchal systems. 

I have also mentioned bonobos. I have mentioned also mentioned matrilineality and matriarchy among Native Americans, Basques, Jews and Minangkabau. Everything I have linked is empirical evidence that patriarchy is not a natural occurring phenomena in humans

But that is not matriarchy, that is the underlying patriarchal systems and social mores which ensure the socialization of women into those gender roles. Nursing and teaching exist *within* patriarchal societies and are not isolated, self-governing entities thereby making them matriarchies. Your statement is very baffling and self-contradictory. If you want to talk about matriarchal societies, talk about non-European societies such the Iroquois, Hopi and Minangkabau. Don't talk about female-dominated professions existing within Western patriarchal frameworks

,2197.0,0,2019-01-20T23:42:49Z,"The following paragraph single-handedly proves you did not bother reading the goddam study about sexual dimorphism in detail. Brain size =/= intellectual capacity. 

""Differences in brain size between males and females should not be
interpreted as implying any sort of functional advantage or disadvantage. Size/function relationships are complicated by the
inverted U shape of developmental trajectories and by the myriad
factors contributing to structure size, including the number and size of
neurons and glial cells, packing density, vascularity, and matrix
composition. However, an understanding of the sexual dimorphism
of brain development, and the factors that influence these trajectories,
may have important implications for the field of developmental
neuropsychiatry where nearly all of the disorders have different ages
of onset, prevalence, and symptomatology between boys and girls.""

The Benbow study you linked highlights parity of educational achievement, while also equally highlighting differences in professional and vocational choices. This phenomena is definitely not an argument for innate intellectual differences. The study is an observation of statistical phenomena, not cognitive traits. The study does not make light of sociological factors which interplay individual decision making choices. 

""Although achieving equally, these men and women and have appeared to have constructed meaningful and satisfying lives that took somewhat different forms. These studies have implications for higher education and expectations of equal representation across all fields"".

,2240.0,0,2019-01-19T12:30:23Z,"Roland let‚Äôs be honest here. Why are a lot of men pissed off by the ad?  It‚Äôs because the ad is insinuating that all men are or are potential rapist.

When in reality, the overwhelming amount of men aren‚Äôt rapist or sexual harass women. It‚Äôs like saying all black people are criminals even though we know that isn‚Äôt true. 

All this ad was for to be center of controversy to keep heir name relevant and eventually will be forgotten about. In my opinion, if you are really offended by the ad, just stop talking about it and stop buying their products. If you don‚Äôt care about the ad, go ahead being a customer.

Young boys are being bullied all the time because they are seen as sissies by their peers, who most likely get their fucked up views from their fathers. I also understand that just like with the Nike commercial, Gillette is doing this because it's profitable for them to look like they are woke, but that doesn't mean that the content of the commercial is inaccurate. 
It's funny how whenever a feminist says something about how unfairly women are treated, a lot of men say ""but what about all these ways men are being treated unfairly.."", but then when someone comes along and wants to help people of the male gender, that is also frowned upon. You just can't win...

Look at the statistics. Black kids were more likely to be employed than white kids in the early 1900's until minimum wage laws were created. Black kids were also more likely to be raised in a two parent household than white kids for a long time. Pre-Civil Rights Movement, the black single motherhood rate was around 20%. Then LBJ and the Democrats passed the welfare for single mothers program and today we see a 70% black single motherhood rate. We also know that being raised by only one parent is the single greatest indicator that a child will end up in prison (this is seen across all races). So if you want to blame someone, blame Democrat policies.

""Does ‚Äúbuild the wall mexicans are rapists and drug dealers‚Äù ring a bell?""

Nobody said all Mexicans are rapists and drug dealers. And a wall is not going to keep out people who want to come here legally. You understand that, right? We would still take in legal immigrants. Nobody has a problem with legal immigrants.

Firstly, You're right i didnt read every one of the comments from you or the OP. We dont all have time to waste on youtube all day.
I observed both your tones changed but i didnt observe his premise change at all from the beginning. That was entirely you, you softened as you begin to understand that ""hey this guy isnt so bad after all""
Which is the exact same thing doctrine the Gillette ad is trying to portray. The premise that ""Men are evil and out to get women"" but when they do these things they become ""good men""
You really should be able to see think link now as ive made it as obvious as it needs to be without being patronizing.

Alright this is the last time i reply as this is like a cat trying to catch its tail and its going nowhere. You believe that the OP or men in general are angry because women have a choice to say no? Is that the premise you're proposing? Nowhere here have i seen a man say that a woman should not be allowed to say no. This is a story you have told yourself over many years and found someone or more aptly a gender to blame. Shifting blame is normal human behaviour so i wouldnt be concerned as someone who deals with this sort of thing on a daily basis with patients. As ive proposed to you before have an instrospective look as to WHY you think this way, whats happened in the past that has caused you to create this neural pathways because the premise you have bought into isnt healthy. There was a stimulus, its up to you to recognise it.

Lastly in response to your second comment. Ironic how you see that yet you fail to see that ive shown you arguments as to why you're the one whos actually doing that. Telling everyone here ""how women think"" whilst only being 1 person in a minority of females. If i was narrow minded id be pretty shit at my job and id ask you to Report me to the Royal College of Psychiatrists in Australia.

Now, please read this carefully: if it's a grocery store, coffee shop, church... any public setting where others are around, this fear is greatly diminished and I do appreciate the confidence it takes to approach someone like that. There's nothing wrong with saying hello to someone and hoping more can come from it.

But on the streets? It's frightening. I've had guys say absurd things like, ""you should be careful out here while you're wearing something like that"" -- when I was wearing a KNEE length skirt and a long sleeved shirt.

This needs to be expanded upon because we've changed the meaning of the word ""community"" online. There¬†is a YouTube ""Community"" here, which I can be a part of wherever I go in the world. I'm in Canada now, but if I were to go to Chad, I could still be part of the ""community"". If I were to go to Antarctica, I would still be part of that ""community"".

But to many rural people (in particular; this seems to be a fairly clear Rural/Urban divide, though not exclusively Rural) community is the LAND. The buildings. Sitting down on a porch with a neighbour after work. Going to Church gatherings (even if it's more for the social aspect than the religious aspect - another thing many Urban folk don't get). That's community to them.¬†And if they physically leave that area? They aren't a part of¬†that community¬†anymore. They don't consider an Online Community to be the same as a real life community. A ""Rural Town in Texas"" Facebook group isn't the same as being in that rural town in Texas.

This is something many Urban people simply don't get. Probably because we've conditioned ourselves over the past 60 years to ""go to where the jobs are"". If you're in Dallas, and a better job opens up in Mobile, you go to Mobile. If a better job opens up in St. Louis, you go to St. Louis. Or New York. Or Los Angeles. Or wherever the job is. And we think about the friends we've made along the way as our ""Community"", and we're content with a facebook post or a text or a phone call once in a while, and maybe we'll go there for a weekend one day when we've got a bit of time, just to have drinks with old friends then go back ""home"".

Rural and Urban folk are using the same words to refer to different things these days - we're divided by a shared language."

That's not a controversial topic. If you can't separate traditional masculinity from abusive behavior there is something wrong with you.

Why would we fucking pay 30+$ for a fucking razor head pack that would last not even 3 month (on a thick and strong beard) if we can have an electric razor that cost 200$ (even less) and just have it for 5+ years

What's left as a big target? Women. Women goes to the pharmacies and stores to buy razor head for their own gilette razor. They shave their leg with it and it's clearly where they get all their money. Since there's a huge pro postfeminist movement against ""manly men"" right now...why wouldnt they aim their publicity to please them.

One case in particular I'm aware of is Old Spice. That ad campaign a few years back was deliberately crafted to appeal to women because they made up the largest portion of their customer base, despite their products being for men.

I've no doubt that Gillette was well aware they'd piss off many men with their ad but that their market research showed the gains would outweigh the losses. Ads like this aren't made on  a whim, tons of research is involved."

Obviously it has affected the culture. You are talking about it. You have been so affected about it, so triggered by it. You mad a video upset. It‚Äôs not attacking all the men.

One 1:30 commercial saying ‚Äúhey maybe don‚Äôt support this behavior because it still exists‚Äù gets this kind of uproar and backlash is exactly why it needs to be. People love to swing on the left for getting triggered but then they do this.

""Toxic masculinity"" is an adverb in front of an adjective. ""Toxic"" describes a kind of masculinity, it is not a description of all masculinity. This is the same as saying poisonous berries. Not all berries are poisonous, but you should avoid the ones that are. Not all masculinity is toxic, but you should avoid the kinds that are. Getting rid of toxic masculinity benefits men just as much as it does women. No more ""man up,"" ""don't be a pussy,"" ""deal with it,"" etc. Men shouldn't feel ashamed about expressing emotion, doing things that are considered ""feminine,"" being victims of rape or abuse, etc. The end of toxic masculinity is positive for everyone, and is completely seperate from masculinity."

I've never been called the C word by a manly man, I've never heard manly men say disgusting things about women or display any hostility toward women. And yes, I've known manly men. I was stationed with Green Berets when I was in the army. They always treated me well and with respect. But the only trouble I've ever had came from wimpy, nerdy insecure men. The soy boys are much more likely to slap you, call you the C word etc...than some manly man. I'd rather work side by side with these so called 'toxic' males than any of these soy boys any day. My father and uncles would absolutely have been called 'toxic' males, but never did they use the C word. They celebrated women and any success we achieved (my uncle, a tall manly man hunter, etc...took care of the kids while his wife was a state senator in Georgia. Never felt even remotely threatened). No, the problem comes not from manly men, but by men not secure in their manliness. This commercial and the agenda it celebrates is disgusting."

Every liberal, leftist, and SJW knows the anger and pain they would feel if such an ad was targeted at women, blacks, gays, etc. Yet, they openly denigrate the very idea of any man being hurt by this ad. It‚Äôs not just hypocrisy and a double standard, it‚Äôs a contempt for empathy.

They are not capable of empathy, sympathy, or compassion for those in their outgroup, and, in this way, they are no different from the white supramicists and homophobes they need to believe are hiding behind every blade of grass.

,2495.0,0,2019-01-19T11:18:57Z,"Joe Smith I think the problem is what you‚Äôre describing in being what a snowflake is. A snowflake is one who is offended by facts. For instance, if someone said that black people make up the majority of crime in the US which is supported by the FBI stats, that is a fact. You‚Äôre a snowflake if you‚Äôre offended by that. Then if someone says, all blacks are criminals, it‚Äôs justified to be offended by that statement as we both know that‚Äôs not true. Regarding this ad, it‚Äôs putting this me too movement on the backs of all men. As in, all men are responsible when in reality, it‚Äôs clearly not all men doing it. By essentially insulting the vast majority of men by the actions of very few, one is justified at being offended. These sweeping messages of ‚Äúawareness‚Äù helps nothing and no one. Companies use this message for their image so they can make more money. They don‚Äôt give a shit about the individual. You see the same shit come out in Hollywood, meanwhile, some of the biggest offenders are being protected by them. Do you really think Harvey Weinstein is the only guy in Hollywood doing what he did?  Of course not. There are many many more and they need to be called out individually. They rather start a hashtag and put the blame on all men moreover the common man instead of owning up to their own sins. 

So in summary, if a regular guy is insulted by this commercial as in insinuates that he too is part of this me too problem and it‚Äôs up to him, the guy without all of the money and influence, to put an end to it is insulting. Gillette should worry about selling razors and stop trying to be the moral lecturer."

Where is that even implied?? *WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT EVEN??* Where are you getting your talking points? Biased idiots on YouTube trying to get views?? And you know that's FACTUALLY true right?? Men are the ones who take up most of the prison population. But NEVER did the commercial ever say or even imply that most toxic behavior is fine by men or that it's masculine. It literally pointed out toxic behavior and said they believe men are BETTER than that and that the ""boys will be boys"" type of excuses aren't true. They were saying boys ARENT inherently hyperviolent to the point of bullying and all that.

I agree that the commercial was disproportional but it raised a conversation, so what if they sell razors? There is a tampon company that made an amazing feminist commercial that really got people talking. I am so sad that you are ""done with the lectures"" and don't want to listen anymore, but the world is still a fucked up place, the amount of gun shooting, racism, there are still so many gender inequalities and discrimination, a lot against women but also against men (underpaying women, gendered communication) it is still here, and saying that most people are not like that is not what the issue is about, because the issue is that some people are still like that, and these people have a great effect on peoples life. I love that because ""most people you met"" were nice that this represents the world, but here are some real statistics (from the National Sexual Violence Resource Center):

- One in five women and one in 71 men will be raped at some point in their lives
- In the U.S., one in three women and one in six men experienced some form of contact sexual violence in their lifetime 
- 81% of women and 35% of men report significant short- or long-term impacts such as Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)

And so since there are around 325 million people in u.s, 108 women will be raped in some point of there lives, meaning there are at least100 million people in the u.s alone that have raped women, is that 'not so many' for you?
These statistics show that while many are not terrible people, some still are! And both men and women are suffering as can be seen, while women are suffering more from this. What the commercial was trying to do was grab peoples attention by disproportionately repressing issues, and trying to tell men that they should also join the conversation. I think that if women and man all around the world are surviving rape and assault, you can also survive this commercial :)"

this was a comment from another video:
I work for P&G the company which owns Gillette. I have to tell you that this stuff goes all the way to the top. A VP said in a 100 person meeting that she will never promote a white man again. There was a diversity training I was forced to go to that put up 2 pictures, one of a white male team, and one of non-whites and we were asked ""i know its an obvious answer, but look at these 2 teams, which would you rather work with?"" Then they hired a black intern right out of college, he was decent but not great, and had his summer boss give him an offer letter. The salary was 15% higher than the manager which had worked for the company for 13 years. The manager quit 2 weeks later, the project they were working on fell apart. I‚Äôve never been more miserable working anywhere in my life.


Marketing strategy of Gillette in short: 
Summary:
So Gillette (a brand of PnG) is now positioning itself as a brand for both men and women because after men started to grow beards the sales went down. For which they used Metoo, feminism and toxicity. Overall a bad one for traditional customers but will help Gillette to get female grooming range sales. So as we say, use women, degrade men, make money.

Key marketing take aways from this strategy:
1) Show all men as toxic.
2) Show beards are a symbol of toxic masculinity 
3) reduce confidence of men.
4) Position themselves as a brand that favours feminism.

What did Gillette use:
1) Metoo movement
2) Accusations 

What did Gillette forget:
1) The majority of accused in Metoo were male feminists
2) Males which are their traditional customer base may start moving out.

What will Gillette gain:
1) A bigger base of women customers
2) An addition of white knights 

What Gillette can't do now:
1) Can't point out the toxic feminshits movement
2) can't tell tumbler hairy queens to shave."

4052.0,,8,2019-01-18T10:31:28Z,"If men feel attacked by that ad then they're definitely the kind of people who do kind of shit, bro. Because if you're the kind of dude who says ""hey man that's not cool, stop it"" to another dude who's catcalling a girl, you just won't feel attacked and won't be outraged by it. Like really, the reactions this ad sparked said it all. If you're not a creep you won't feel attacked, you'll only feel attacked if you are indeed a creep. Which means the message was conveyed effectively. 
Also don't come at me with ""not all men"". The ad avoided that angle specifically by showing how culture teaches men to behave a certain way, but others can think for themselves and see some things are wrong and hurtful. And by saying ""just sell me shit and shut up"", you're saying you don't care for all the young boys who get beaten up by their peers, for women who get sexually harassed on the regular and generally for being a real man who doesn't pull shit just to feel more masculine, because if you're confident about your masculinity then you won't feel the need to show off with fights or insistently harassing women sexually. 
So basically, the men who pull that shit aren't ""real men"". Real men will say something about it and stop other men from doing it."

,2527.0,0,2019-01-18T18:48:51Z,"I‚Äôm sure this made you feel better but your logic is flawed. 

If I don‚Äôt like a razor company making an ad about bullying or sexual assault, as if those are only male issues, that means I condone both?  No it means I don‚Äôt think this was the right forum for it. If you think most guys don‚Äôt already know sexual assault or bullying are destructive behaviors you‚Äôre part of the problem.

Let‚Äôs break down catcalling. It used to mean shouting things at women either to get your kicks or maybe get her to respond. Somehow seeing a girl you think looks good and approaching her respectfully is now considered ‚Äúcatcalling.‚Äù  Bullshit. 

Men have the responsibility to make the approach and now by making the approach something is wrong with men? Do you see the flawed logic here?  What you‚Äôre saying is guys should wish themselves into sex or a relationship, cause we know women aren‚Äôt gonna take that first step.  Approaching a woman on the street isn‚Äôt destructive behavior. Some women like it and some don‚Äôt but it‚Äôs like the lottery, you gotta buy a ticket to win.  

Sexual assault is wrong and most guys know it. Big problem is the definition is different for so many people. Some women treat bad sex or drunk sex like that really constitutes an assault. Some people think if I have a magazine with half naked women that‚Äôs considered harassment, I still can‚Äôt wrap my mind around that one. Once again telling men they‚Äôre defective for their normal drives/desires.  

Bullying leads down a bad road and we know it, but there‚Äôs growth to be had in learning how to deal with such a huge obstacle in your life. 
The amount of people who think bullying is ok is so small there‚Äôs barely any guys who are gonna say ‚Äúno it‚Äôs cool just let them jump that kid.‚Äù  Unfortunately dominance hierarchies are part of being a human and they‚Äôre gonna develop regardless. We can stop it when we find it before it gets too far but what‚Äôs Gillette really hoping to achieve? 

Plus this whole self-policing thing that feminism has been introducing into the world is laughable given how many women destroy men‚Äôs lives on a regular basis. Only problem is society doesn‚Äôt see them as problems because ‚Äúwomen have been so repressed this is the way things should have been‚Äù.

Man gets divorced raped and everything he‚Äôs worked for is gone? Nobody cares. 

Man gets his dick cut off and thrown in a garbage disposal? Hilarious. 

Man gets fired because female coworker thought him touching her shoulder was ‚Äútoo familiar?‚Äù Everything looks in order here!

If we‚Äôre gonna call out destructive behavior it can‚Äôt be unidirectional. It‚Äôs fucking annoying that men and women have to be so divided about these things, and to be honest it‚Äôs because manhood and masculinity are being diminished so that femininity can somehow be empowered."

'Toxic blackness' isn't a thing and even if it was it doesn't have the same power as toxic masculinity does, you might as well be asking 'what if the sky was purple' it's pointless. I'll try and explain why. The notion of toxic masculinity teaches you that vioence is a great idea, getting ahead in life is all that matters, to put down people better than you and so on. We're talking about the dominant power structure of western civilisation. It sits in the white house 'grab 'em by the pussy' to quote the president. It says things like 'boys will be boys' in response to comments like that. Well, no, dickheads will be dickheads should be the appropriate response and we, as a society, shouldn't reward that behaviour but we do by electing it as president and by trying to emulate it in our own behaviours whether we're aware of it or not.
I'm not invalidating your opinon. Again? Why you so precious about someone disagreeing with you? You sound a bit snowflakey really. You clearly are offended, saying you find the ad distasteful is another way of saying you're offended. You might not give a shit I'm not offended, well, I don't give a shit that you are offended. In fact I find it rather funny.
At the end of the day it's a fucking razor commercial and it's a brilliant one from a marketing perspective because it's gone viral and everyone is talking about it for free in newspapers, online, in magazines and in podcasts. All the crybabies saying their going to boycott it is funny too. Do you think Gillette gives a fuck? Precious little whiners on the Internet are not their target market."

But sure, throw that logic out the window when it‚Äôs men that we are talking about. You act as if I‚Äôm the only person ‚Äúoffended‚Äù by the ad, when in reality a large number of people found the ad distasteful, with the rest being a small minority of people like you who have nothing better to do than to try to invalidate people‚Äôs opinions.

It's a marketing campaign, they've jumped on the #metoo bandwagon and done it very successfully but you can't deny there has been, for decades and decades, a particular type of masculinity that's mainstream and has been accepted for way too long. That type of masculinity is the type that thinks fighting is great and that women are nothing more than cunts on legs that need conquering. 
It's also the type that calls men like me pussies etc simply for not going along with the same philosophy or having any interest in typical 'manly' pursuits like cage fighting or whatever.
Yeah there's a type of femininity that's really shit too and, if you look carefully, it's often the type that tries to immitate shit masculinity like the one I just described.

The whole ""bad apples"" argument is flawed because it assumes that violence is an entirely individualized phenomena and the neglects the role socialization and acculturation plays in shaping in violence perpetrated by men. Also, before you falsely tout the ad as ""anti-masculine"", know that masculine roles have varied enormously throughout human history. The ad concerns two very specific aspects of masculinity: harassment and bullying. The ad is certainly not anti-sewing (a masculine role in 17th century Scotland), anti-piety (a masculine trait of medieval Europe), anti-wisdom, anti-courage, anti-integrity. To claim that the use of the term toxic masculinity = anti-male is a blatant strawman of the term."

I think you will benefit greatly from reading up on feminist theory by the likes of Judith Butler and bell hooks, rather than kneejerk against strawmanned caricatures of feminism.

If you're not doing these sexist behaviours then it's not aimed at you, and all it's asking of you is that you help other men to improve. The 'is this the best a man can get' is referencing the examples they're specifically showcasing in the ad, i.e. bullying, violence etc.. They then go on to showcase a whole range of great behaviours that men perform, but also let us know that we need more people like that. Do you actually think a majority of men actively stamp out sexist behaviour? I'm guessing there's just a lot of hyper-masculine guilty men around here.

Also, I love that you say that most people aren't racist then say that people think a southern accent makes you stupid - hey mate that's racism :p.

First off the two kids play wresting - what's wrong with that? You can't completely strip a man of his instincts, men like to fight. They weren't hurting each other. I don't see any problem with two boys wrestling around. Also the guy on the street when the girl walked past - he saw an attractive girl and was going to approach her? If he was just gonna whistle or yell something offensive out then fair enough, but it looked as though he was walking towards her to start a conversation, which I see nothing wrong with. I think Gillette went a bit too far - there's nothing wrong with masculinity or male traits, only if they negatively impact someone else should it be a problem."

That you dummies were taught isn't real. That sterilized women through the 80's even without permission. Black women. Initiated and pushed hard with Planned Parenthoods Margaret Sanger. 

You know how republicans mention planned parenthood but they teach you tards we just hate abortion not to listen. OR we specifically don't like Planned Parenthood that the government funds and HAS funded for decades. That pursued ""exterminating the diseased DNA of the negro race"" as you can see in the historical documents in the Library of Congress. Or the eugenics sterilizing women without their knowledge or permission through the 80's or the selling of baby parts....for profit. Removing healthy 20 week plus fetuses...to sell their parts. Gross. 

Don't look into it though.

The Library of Congress holds all historical protected documents in this country. Like the letters between Margaret Sanger (who started planned parenthood) and Dr. Clarence Gamble. Who created Proctor and Gamble. All participated in convincing the nation to fund the eugenics programs. There are still trials today in NC with victims fighting for pay out.

The true foundation planned parenthood was based on those abortions, and eugenics. Documentation of it for years is in the Library of Congress letters and addresses between them and other Drs involved. Not surprising because William Sanger Margaret‚Äôs husband immigrated straight off the Reich in Germany right before Hitler took rule. Hitler also pushes eugenics to keep their white race pure. 

Our history is very sick but what‚Äôs even sicker is the hypocrisy of it all. The ones pushing the agendas always did it in the name of better society big picture or ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs right to choose‚Äù. The women fighting the cases in NC against the eugenics programs had no right to choose...they were sterilized without permission.

Also in what world is a BBQ, and cigars and male get togethers more harmful to male/female interactions and a guy saying ‚Äúhey cutie‚Äù on the street....worse than what the rap industry portrays of men/women interactions?

They will ""friend zone"" him and either ignore his calls and texts or worse yet, keep him around as an orbiter to feed their ego and perhaps use him to help them out or buy things for them.  I have never been a guy like this, but I know quite a few who are.  I try to help them to change, but most are very stubborn and insist that they will find the unicorn who will appreciate them.

Since the 1960s single motherhood rate in the black community went from 20% to 70% currently (is that good or bad) and why did people actually go door to door telling people in the inner cities if they voted dem they wouldn't need a father in the home.

The market is saturated with triple A titles to the point that shovelware can exist. You're comparing apples woth oranges. Battlefield's issue is the EA that, like Fallout, the franchise is dying. 

Also....your 'down in sales' figure doesn't include digital sales. While that, admittedly, doesnt make the sales great...it does mean that battlefield sold an extra 1.4 million units digitally, nearly as much as fallout 76 had with its horrible launch. Enough sales to still make it debut at number four the week it came out. ;-)

I‚Äôm talking to the feminists when I say ‚Äúso go ahead ladies.‚Äù They do dress like weirdos in nipple pasties, they have their slut walks, and instead of fighting against the sexualization of women in media, they‚Äôre fighting against men. It‚Äôs super counterproductive. Feminists want to blame everyone else for toxic masculinity, but what are they doing to stop it, besides screeching? I‚Äôm sure putting on a thong and walking around in public embracing their sluthood as a good thing is really helping to make men respect women. üòë"

Very few of them were in a long term relationship/marriage with a man, who suddenly became a dick and left. They were always dicks, and the decision to conceive a child with them was always stupid. Women have a choice when it comes to sex and relationships. Many of them choose wrong.

,2842.0,0,2019-01-18T19:30:37Z,"""attaching a connotation to"" retracts from the premise that it exists entirely separate from normal masculinity, therefore the rest of your diatriabe is strawmanned. 
""Ad Hominem"" intends an argument directed at a person, however the statistical validity of the existence of a moral amplitude for the ""toxic"" version of ""masculinity"" is undeniable across international census. That is the crossroads in which civilization stands against technology; the necessity of male barbarism is extinct but not the barbaric males themselves. 
Two generations, maybe less. Star Trek time, baby. I understand how you feel when you hear the term, and to some degree your argument holds a certain shallow validity; however it is not as blanketing a term as you assert it to be. It is, in my opinion, highly succinct - but as you see you and I are outliers from the general public and I admit that my usage of the term may differ enough from the layman's that my argument may be based in a personalized interpretation. However, we cannot ignore that:
1. Men are physically dominant. 
2. Men historically have use violence to exert moral dominance. 
3. A large enough percentage of the male population believes in the power of aggressive dominance or does not stop it from happening that men statistically commit significantly more crime despite being the lesser of the sexual population, and making more money, and historically having more rights. https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2012/crime-in-the-u.s.-2012/tables/42tabledatadecoverviewpdf/table_42_arrests_by_sex_2012.xls
4. Social sciences support diplomacy over war. 
5. Technology produces energy more and more affordably and sustainably throughout time. 
6. Wars are fought for resources, or religion. 
7. The average human intelligence is rising steadily, especially with the introduction of advanced communications technology and religion is on the decline. 
8. Aggressive tendencies are more prevalent in a less intelligent society. I.E. The Savannah Principle. 

 ""Toxic Masculinity"" is not typically used to undermine an argument made by men, but to condemn unnecessarily aggressive actions that are paid at cost by others, in which you falsely imply that ""hysterical women"" carries a comparative connotation. 

One may surmise that: men are still physically and criminally dominant while many men still hold the belief that they must express that dominance in order to be ""natural"", as we see in the tables showing violent crime and via The Savannah Principle, and that is how they define ""masculinity""; erring often in their logic through the scope of ""religion (another evolutionary tool of a bygone era), which they express onto others making it ""toxic"" in a technologically, scientifically, communicatively, and philosophically advanced society. That is the perspective I've arrived at, anyway."

4470.0,,0,2019-01-17T22:36:39Z,"The Gillette commercial is partly okay, but it also has its stupid moments.

The man who broke up a fight between two young boys, and the man who stopped those teenagers from assaulting that boy are showing good moral character. Violence is for cowards, it always has been. And if all men practiced non-violence then even learning self-defense wouldn't be necessary. A good father recognizes the difference between his son's natural healthy masculine aggression, and an act of violence against another human being. But too many idiots in this world think that aggression and violence are somehow the same thing. There are multiple ways that boys and men can take out their aggression without resorting to violence. Play a sport, or exercise, or play a ""violent"" video game, or have rough sex with your girlfriend/wife if she is into that sorta thing. A strong man defeats his enemies with his mind/brain, using reason, logic, and creative witty humorous insults, not with his fists.
 
As for the part in the commercial that annoyed me was when that black white knighted asshole stopped that man from pursuing that hot blonde woman. Um, so wanting to get laid is now a bad thing? lol Yea, let's demonize the natural human sex drive and libido? Hey Gillette, since when did you board the Puritanical Prude Train? Since when did feeling horny ever hurt anybody? Secondly, what made that black dude think that the other dude's sex life was any of his bloody business? If the woman didn't want to have sex, then she always has the right to say no. Why would feminism promote to women that ""no means no"" if they don't even have the opportunity to say it, all because some douche bag decided to appoint himself as ""protector"" of women's vaginas? So much for strong, independent women. So that black dude might as well have just shouted ""Women don't know how to speak for themselves!"".

So screw you Gillette! There is nothing wrong with a man who wants some booty!"

4473.0,,0,2019-01-17T22:33:56Z,"Research in diverse cultures demonstrates that fathers‚Äô warmth contributes greatly to children‚Äôs long-term favorable development. In studies of many societies and ethnic groups around the world, researchers coded paternal expressions of love and nurturance‚Äîevident in such behaviors as cuddling, hugging, comforting, playing, verbally expressing love, and praising the child‚Äôs behavior. Fathers‚Äô sustained affectionate involvement predicted later cognitive, emotional, and social competence as strongly as did mothers‚Äô warmth‚Äîand occasionally more strongly (Rohner & Veneziano, 2001; Veneziano, 2003). And in Western cultures, paternal warmth and secure attachment is associated with children‚Äôs mature social behavior and protects them against a wide range of difficulties, including childhood emotional and behavior problems and adolescent substance abuse and delinquency (Grant et al., 2000; Michiels et al., 2010; Nelson & Coyne, 2009; Tacon & Caldera, 2001).
Fathers who devote little time to physical caregiving express warmth through play. In a German study, fathers‚Äô play sensitivity‚Äîaccepting toddlers‚Äô play initiatives, adapting play behaviors to toddlers‚Äô capacities, and responding appropriately to toddlers‚Äô expressions of emotion‚Äîpredicted children‚Äôs secure internal working models of attachment during middle childhood and adolescence (Grossmann et al., 2002). Through play, fathers seemed to transfer to young children a sense of confidence about parental support, which may strengthen their capacity to master many later challenges.
What factors promote paternal warmth? Cross-cultural research reveals a consistent association between the amount of time fathers spend near infants and toddlers and their expressions of caring and affection (Rohner & Veneziano, 2001). Consider the Aka hunters and gatherers of Central Africa, where fathers spend more time in physical proximity to their babies than in any other known society. Observations reveal that Aka fathers are within arm‚Äôs reach of infants more than half the day. They pick up, cuddle, and play with their babies at least five times as often as fathers in other hunting-and-gathering societies. Why are Aka fathers so involved? The bond between Aka husband and wife is unusually cooperative and intimate. Throughout the day, couples share hunting, food preparation, and social and leisure activities. The more Aka parents are together, the greater the father‚Äôs loving interaction with his baby (Hewlett, 1992).
In Western cultures as well, fathers in gratifying marriages feel more confident about their parenting skills and spend more time with and interact more effectively with their infants. In contrast, marital dissatisfaction is associated with insensitive paternal care (Grych & Clark, 1999; Lundy, 2002; Sevigny & Loutzenhiser, 2010). Clearly, mothers‚Äô and fathers‚Äô warm interactions with each other and with their babies are closely linked. But paternal warmth promotes long-term favorable development, beyond the influence of maternal warmth (Rohner & Veneziano, 2001). Evidence for the power of fathers‚Äô affection, reported in virtually every culture and ethnic group studied, is reason to encourage more men to engage in nurturing care of young children."

First of all I don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs wrong in pointing out toxic masculinity, secondly, why shouldn't it be Gillette places to discuss topic, when that is exactly what it has been doing for many years trough it‚Äôs commercial. It has been reproducing the stereotypical ideas of manliness. Now it points out the problems of toxic masculinity and all of a sudden it‚Äôs is sexist?

Check this Gillette commercial from the 80‚Äôs full of conservative representations of men as strong sports folk, astronauts, Wall-street businessmen, in manly suits. To me this ad, and many other commercials and movies is visual culture which has been affecting the way we view and understand what it is to be a man.

Instead of pointing the finger at men and saying this is how men are bad maybe focus on addressing and encouraging what is positive and how to act?

Dont shave, B. Kids are assholes and C. bullying is an issue that is so far outside of strict toxic masculinity that I think a seperate campaign not treating it like a male issue would have been more apt.

Are you seriously gonna sit there and tell me that your gonna get offended over an ad that says more or less men need to call out other men and hold them responsible their actions and what may be considered ""toxic"" behavior in the workplace and elsewhere. And that ""men need to be good role models for their kids because they'll be the men of the future. Along with being against bullying and harrassment.

At the end of the day it's guys like you that we don't want running into a burning building to save our kids or on the battlefield.

Oh right, they said stuff like ""MASCULINITY SO FRAGILE"" and ""BUY MY NEW MALE TEARS MUG!"" (feminists actually started the ""drink tears"" meme) and eventually ""KILL ALL MEN"". So men closed themselves off again and decided to stop chasing the political dragon. And now we're being shamed again.

I wasn't even for boycotts but that shit is going too far. Young boys will see that, boys that are already ashamed of what they ARE, they haven't even developed WHO they are yet and the world is telling them they're bad just because of things they can't help. They're being told that the girls and the boys who become girls and the gay kids are all better than them. Why? Because we're ignorant, thoughtless, myopic and evil.

This shit is all just so obviously wrong and dangerous, I can't help but go into a conspiratorial way of thinking when I see this crap. They obviously seem to want men to not be strong and masculine in a positive way anymore. (You know this because they aren't fighting machismo, they're fighting masculinity. Those two things have been conflated. Everyone I talk to thinks ""masculine"" and ""macho"" mean the same thing because the media has made them the same thing.) 

Why are they claiming to have the backs of trans people yet they completely neglect women who become more masculine? Why is it ALL about boys becoming girls? Why have they got sexually charged DRAG QUEENS visiting children in schools encouraging ONLY the boys to become girls? If this is about trans rights where are the girls becoming boys? It's obvious what this all is. I can't help but wonder why they're doing this? Why do they want men to be in a state where they won't want to fight back?"

Especially when with issues like domestic violence it is both men and women that are victims. Also - think about this ad being created in reverse. Lets say an ad was made about women as mothers not killing their children, beating them, or assaulting their husbands. 

Feminists would go mental over an ad like that. The outrage would receive huge media support, but people complaining about this Gillette ad would just get told to be quiet. There is an obvious double standard that exists. Also - ads like this annoy me because I know that they're fuelled by a resentment filled leftist point of view, which is very fucking bias and never based on any scientific research. You've got dumb shit commercials like this popping up showing that the issues of DV, sexual harassment, rape etc are a cause of not calling out trivial stupid behaviour....go and do some fucking research and you'll see there's no research to suggest that. 

Poverty, being sexually abused as a child, drugs, alcohol, inequality and low income families etc etc - all much larger leading causes. The list goes on....but here we have a fucken ad that says it all comes from the average dudes somewhat inappropriate behaviour, which for some reason shows black guys calling out white heterosexual males. Why is all research neglected? Because it's fuelled by that agenda and leftist ideology. All real and other issues will be ignored and men will be shown to be the problem. You are wrong, it is sexist, it is not a fair commercial, and it shows men as the issue."

You know how they talk about domestic abuse and they almost always have it aimed at men. Why is this commercial which seems less serious causing so much offense when those don't?

Also why is this commercial made by a company that is a white owned company causing you to attack black people? Like even if you feel it makes white men specifically look bad. What is the reasoning behind attack black men as if that makes you look better? Wouldn't that only make you look racist? since again this is a white owned company.

Finally. I see all the time other races crying about not being represented or hired in movies and tv and white people calling them sissies and crybabies etc etc. Now y'all are mad because you say other races weren't represented or hired. Do you not see the irony there?

(a) Why are they only talking about men being assholes?  Women are assholes too, just as often.
""You too"" fallacy. Doesn't change the validity of the argument.
(b) Why is it every man's responsibility to say or do something, but no woman's responsibility?
Because Gillette sells male products. Women already try to speak out, but are often silenced.
(c) Do they honestly think they're saying anything that hasn't been heard before?
There are some things worth repeating, e.g. drink driving, dangers of smoking, slip/slap/slop, etc. Obviously this message has not been broadcast enough. Many people don't even know what ""toxic masculinity"" is. They think it means being male is toxic.
(d)  They're equating masculinity and bad behavior.  
No, they're not. They're saying toxic masculinity (a modern construction of being male that is associated with stoicism, aggression, dominance, and competitiveness, according to the American Psychological Association) is harmful. 

""Guys already call out anyone who's being an asshole, so the ad is dumb on many levels.""

They do? I saw a bunch of cricketers laughing when a particular big-name cricketer was trying to ask out a female interviewer on live TV because he thought it was funny and it made him look masculine and cool. None of them thought about how she felt. 

That said, one ad is not going to change anything. People like Terry Crews are going to carry on being positive role models and people like James Woods, who allegedly propositioned underage girls to go to Las Vegas with him, will continue to hate the ad. And people like Martin Luther King's daughter, who wrote ""This commercial isn‚Äôt anti-male. It‚Äôs pro-humanity"" know that her dad would not have been offended by the ad."

(d)  They're equating masculinity and bad behavior.  That's why it's every man's responsibility to do or say something.  They're assigning blame based on gender, and by extension, responsibility.

Guys already call out anyone who's being an asshole, so the ad is dumb on many levels.

For the record I don't have a problem with men being feminine, I'm a skinny af dude who has a high pitched voice and cries at movies, I'm not exactly the masculine ideal lol.

,3073.0,0,2019-01-18T14:09:22Z,"@T R I suppose the part that I'm struggling to come to gripes with within all of that is that I would absolutely refuse to call things like sexual assault a 'masculine behaviour'.

Nor would I agree with the point that violence is an acceptable part of the male psyche. We have a tolerance for it, but I'd reason that we have a tolerance for any violence as it's part of the 'human' psyche.

That being said a tolerance is far from acceptance. We tolerate that people can get angry and hurt people, but we don't accept these actions. If you hurt someone out of anger, you'd better have a damn good excuse for doing it, man or woman.

Statistics show that crimes of violence and violence in general is more likely to occur from men for a variety of reasons, (being physically stronger on average as an example), but I feel like the variance is too high to restrict such behaviours to men.

I've had many experiences in my life to base my claims around, the most prominent of those being that I, as a guy am very passive, lack a competitive nature almost entirely, and at times can be admittedly fairly emotional, grew up around women who are some of the hardest people I know to date.

I suppose to also clarify, I don't see a problem with the 'premise' of the theory, just the verbiage. I think that violence isn't practical in 99% of problems in todays world, but I think we shouldn't restrict the wording to men. Not only because it seems a bit dismissing to the fact that violence are occurred by men and women, but imagine how offensive it would sound to say that an aggressive women is being ""toxically masculine""."

Couple things that dont sit well 1) YES commercials have the ability to change society because media affects ALOT of the way we think subconsciously and also it sparks conversation around a topic 2) This commercial did not target ALL men or decent men so for anyone who feels like it threatened they're masculinity needs to revaluate why being a less shitty person does that ( wild guess your idea of masculinity is outdated)

Life is apparently so simple for you that if someone has a nuanced opinion about an issue, they are ""the reason the ad needed to be made."" That's ridiculous. 

I don't like the ad because it uses GENDER to promote good behavior, Because it LITERALLY says all men need to do better, as if I'm going around attacking women, abusing them, marginalizing them. It's THE WAY THE MESSAGE WAS DELIVERED that is offensive. The same way you would be offended if I made a short movie that showed only women and showed them bullying others, or keeping children from their fathers, and explained that you needed to do something to fix this behavior. That you needed to be a better woman, because young women are out there and they are looking up to you. That's an oversimplification of an issue, and it's unfair. Because it bases it's message on gender. It's called identity politics, and it's not only a left-wing tactic, it's a tactic used by both sides to divide us. It should be opposed.

Want to tell men to keep other men accountable? That's a great message. But this was not the way to deliver the message, by framing the entire male gender as the root of the problem."

,3110.0,0,2019-01-18T10:43:40Z,"being a good person is a bit shallow for several reasons. 

1. You didn't say be a good MAN, probably because you don't think such a thing has a definition. Being a good ""person"" means not being too manly or to womanly. Men, act less manly, women, act less womanly. Let's all be moderate humans who don't challenge each other. 

2. A good person is an outside opinion/reputation, or a score at best. It's not a quality. (See #5 for example of a quality)

3. More than just men are offended by this. ""People"" don't like men being portrayed as the terrible sex that need to be less manly. Women like manly men, so they get offended by this ad no matter how ""good"" they are.

3.5. Manly men are rough (or direct in their communication style at least), physical, and competitive with each other. THEY SHOULD NOT BE THIS WAY WITH WOMEN. Why not? Because women are mothers and sisters and daughters. They are precious and special. There is nothing to compare them to.

4. Men have a calling to be good men, and women have a calling to be good women. No one actually has a calling to be a good person. Read ""Wild at Heart"" by John Eldridge. 

4.5 Or just study the psychology of men and women. (It will take longer than just reading the book first though)

5. If you said Oh don't be offended...just be positive, your comment could have actually been applicable. Some people make positivity their main goal. So much so, that they don't analyze anything bad, like this ad, or this society."

I thought toxic masculinity was the traits in men that feminist think are an affront to gender equality. I loosely (and semi-jokingly) tied those ""toxic masculine traits"" to the presence of testosterone, which has decreased in men over the past few decades as a result of a grand pacification of sorts (don't quote me though. I don't usually debate this topic that much). 

In my comment, I insinuate that this ad seems to attribute regular ""manly"" activities such as chasing females or rough housing to a ""toxicity"" of sorts, which I think is just regular, testosterone-induced ""man behavior"". To rob men of these behaviors is to, for lack of a better word, ""castrate"" them, hence why I make the joke that Gillette is ""destroying"" (though more appropriately, ""reducing"") their customer base by stifling the presence of testosterone, which happens to be a major contributor to hair growth."

,3191.0,0,2019-01-18T01:21:42Z,"Despair Bear    Ok, so by your logic, as a woman, I am sexually harassing other women, teaching my boys to fight and displaying misogynistic behaviors. I‚Äôm sorry that makes no sense. I told you my concern but I will repeat cause I think you missed it. I am concerned about my sons seeing a commercial that promotes the beliefs that most men carry these negative traits. Men should not be labeled and demonized. And you glossed over my point earlier. If we took men out of the equation and made a commercial high lighting the negative stereotypes of a race other then white, or homosexuals or even women, would you support that commercial?"
,3192.0,0,2019-01-18T00:27:19Z,"@V Sand But if you don't associate with those character traits with yourself then I fail to see the problem, because if you don't then the ad isn't offensive to you and actually frames you as a hero.  The ad simply said that if you see general douchbaggery, stand up against it, and that we should raise our children to not be submissive pussies when you see someone being an asshole.  This is classic cowboy shit for fucks sake."
,3193.0,0,2019-01-18T00:17:59Z,"‚Äã@Richard Smith If you don't have the character attributes of the douchebags in the commercial, then what is the concern? The only way I could see someone being truly offended is if they associate themselves with the douchebags presented.  Otherwise, you were depicted as a hero who stands for strong moral and family values and who would make/does make an excellent father.  If anything, this ad is not only talking to men, but it's promoting that ""these are good men"" so thus all the guys that complain about women not wanting ""nice guys"", this culturally promotes the nice guy as strong, caring and a good partner.  I fail to see the problem with any of that.  

Personally, the ad to me just seemed like the old school cowboy mentality of ""stick up for women and don't be a douchebag"".  I don't see anything liberal about this.  The original country music scene was ALL about those values."

The message of the ad is to men that they need to be invisible, selfless and not engage in behaviors that have a risk of causing discomfort to a woman. Unless a woman might need them in which case they need to step up regardless of any bad consequences that might affect them. It views men only as objects who are bad by nature and have to redeem themselves through being in service of others and by suppressing that bad nature in themselves and in other boys and men. At the same time Gillette Venus commercials are telling women they are in charge, set the rules and live their lives however they please. This compilation of the worst ideas of the worst elements of the radical feminists is Procter & Gamble's view of gender equality.

You have to dismiss a lot of imagery and implications in that ad to make it acceptable to any sensible person, which is what you see in the comments that support the commercial: ""YOU THINK SEXUAL HARASSMENT IS GOOD!?!?"" - as if that is all the commercial was about."

Why are you all being offended by this ? I just dont get it.  
Im a teacher and i know that the 7 first years of your life are very important, 
and when you're a young boy or girl this type of shit can determine what you're going to think until you learn to unlearn them.
When i see those reaction it's like none of us have acted like a masculin jerk in our lives.
When i was young i said dumb shit to girls, and acted like a jerk with some of my ex-gf. I've done stupid things to prove other boys that i was a tough. Hurted myself and the others.
And for sure im not the only one, i see toxic behavior in a lot of people around me kids and adults. (Not just Men for sure)
Can we just admit that ? Can we just say that we can raise of children with a better understanding of this ?

Nobody said masculinity is toxic, it's just about when it becomes toxic. That's very different.
Men commit a lot more suicides than woman, that's part of the consequences of toxic masculinity. 

I rather get this type of add than a sexist one. 
No offense but Im not on board with Joe for this one. I think you're all over-reacting to something very innocent.
Im not even mad at this, just wondering why all the fuss."

For me, after getting fed up with overpriced Gillette cartridges I finally said fuck it and bought a women's straight razor from a local beauty shop and some salon level shaving gel for less than the price of a provide and let me tell you those products are 1000 times better than any manly brand especially if you wanna line your beard nicely.

I'm politically a believer in an economic democracy(like America was in the 20's) and with this ad Gillette was trying to shame me and label me and other rational people like many of you as mysoginistic homophobes because we don't agree with their politics and even though I'm not white but if I was they would label be based on my skin color. And I've been using women's products for years because a friend of mine who was gay recommended it to me for beard maintenance. After trying  them I found that they're simply better, and bearded gay guys are the men in a gay relationship according to hin. Honestly Manliness is really about how you conduct yourselves and if someone thinks using overpriced razors marketed to men to shave makes them more manly.... then that guy is probably a repressed homosexual or he's from Boston.

These companies are trying to say that believing in Liberty and freedom of expression makes us fascist while labelling people for mundane objects due to a political belief makes them freedom fighters. 

These guys are using our belief and acceptance their entitlement to freedom of expression to tell us that we are fascists. Let your dollars do the talking guys, and buy Kirkland, David, hydro, professional barbar razors or my recommendation of women's razors(try them guys, they're amazing) from Gillette's competitors and watch them commit to their bullshit ideology, lash out at you for being a nazi as they slowly diminish their market share so more local competitors can enter and the economy can get better.

I have not run into a situation where ""boys will be boys"" would be used to justify malicious behavior. In the minds of radical feminists of course that is the only use for it and there's a widespread acceptance for rape and torture of girls because of it.

Let's examine this further though. Procter & Gamble had a campaign with the ""like a girl"" phrase. To do something like a girl has meant that you are doing something clumsily. You might've seen a girl throw a ball for example and notice that they're on average not as skilled at it as boys. What did Procter & Gamble do? They certainly didn't use the phrase to shame girls and demand them to be better. Neither did they want that phrase to be banned. They instead wanted to change it to mean something positive. To do something ""like a girl"" would have to mean that it's done well. That's what they campaigned for.

Why does ""boys will be boys"" not get the same treatment? Why not embrace it and make it mean something positive? They settle with demonizing boys and that phrase is perfect for it. If boys can't be boys, what does that make boys? Bad."

Feminists, in order to perpetuate their hatred of men and boys, have attempted to claim that this phrase is used as an excuse for sexual assault, attempting to imply that sexual assault is a ""normal"" activity for boys. This is however completely false, and this phrase does not in any way apply to anything harmful, not even for less serious crimes such as theft. The phrase itself can be traced back to 1589, where as the earliest claim that it has anything to do with excusing sexual assault can only be traced to the mid 2010's (with feminists being the only source).

For example they discourage aggression and encourage nurturing of children. The real moral dichotomy is not between feminine and masculine traits, those are complementary. The moral dichotomy is between the virtuous masculinity and the vicious masculinity. For example, in the realm of aggression you have to encourage the virtuous aggression and discourage the vicious one. You encourage men who fight to protect and you discourage those who fight to hurt. That is not incompatible with also adopting feminine traits which can be useful to men in some context. The framing of the dichotomy between the feminine and the masculine, especially when the focus is on negative aspect of masculine traits and the positive of the feminine, is what causes the polarized response. Also to be fair the Gillette ad did it right at some points, probably even more right than wrong, but it was mixed and it also was open to interpretation, because they were just quick scenes without much context or detail."

,3307.0,0,2019-01-18T07:56:01Z,"@Maxwell Barnhart I think, he says that, because it shows toxic behavior only by white males. But there is some black men on the commercial stepping in between the white male and the female. So this is a message. And it's not without reason, I guess, because Gillette avoids the racism shitstorm with that. They pretty sure know what they are doing there."
,3308.0,0,2019-01-18T00:47:20Z,"visualpun650 Society can‚Äôt have it both ways, vicious masculinity is what‚Äôs needed when you have men on the frontline fighting for our freedom. Imagine a commercial portraying women as making false rape allegations and telling them how they can do better. Will you be okay with that? Our behaviour in society comes from many influences, mainly our closest relationships during childhood, to a large extent this forms our morals and ethics. It‚Äôs simply patronising that a company feels it has the ability to shape those beliefs in a two minute commercial. Not to mention if someone is a sexual predator they‚Äôre never going to watch this ad and think I should change my ways. That would take years of therapy and an unraveling of complex issues that has created that person. Therefore the ad serves no use whatsoever except disrespect an entire gender."

We complain that corporations are greedy and all they want is to sell u stuff. Here is a company spending a ton of money to help men change for the better and to hopefully help women not get harassed as much. The commercial comes down kinda hard but shouldnt real men be able to take it? The commercial mention 2x that some men already get it! They clarify this is not a calling out of all men as some critcs like to have you think. If you are an admirer of virtuous masculinity and not vicious masculinity... as one commenter put it... then you shouldnt be made crazy by this ad.

,3314.0,0,2019-01-17T22:21:58Z,"The problem isn't that it's discouraging toxic behavior, the problem is that it antagonizes and generalizes men. I remember when I first read an article criticizing the ""boys will be boys"" saying, the first thing that ran across my head was ""finally someone is criticizing the act of generalizing stupid and destructive behavior with being a boy"" but nope, they pretended it was used as some excuse for boys behavior. Do some boys act foolishly? Of course we all do, but to generalize that behavior to being a boy is sexist and discriminatory. This is my problem with the ad is it takes the worst qualities of a person and generalizes them to masculine behavior. The more we contributed these particular traits of an individual with being masculine the more we perpetuated it."

The entire thing was about having the sternness and assertiveness to stand up to each other and hold each other accountable. That is a positive, constructive use of aggression."

5225.0,,0,2019-01-17T04:57:50Z,"How on earth does it make every man look deuchey? Seriously, Joe!üòÇ

Did you not see the dudes making a difference?

I think what is actually happening is that some people are taking this as Gillette‚Äôs attempt to shame all men, and given that we are a culture that THRIVES on shame (political systems, criminal *in*justice, ‚Äúbad kids,‚Äù various opinions, ethnicity shaming, etc.), I believe this is the price we pay: people get defensive (and act offensively) because they feel wounded.

I don‚Äôt personally take offense at it.

Honestly, I mostly take it as marketing, just like Nike supporting the controversial Colin football player.

Still, I think there is a sad reality of truth to what they‚Äôve said, and while I don‚Äôt think that we are all guilty of the level of assault and violence against women shown, I think we could all use multiple reminders that these things happen, and we can use our masculinity to make a difference.

Isn‚Äôt that ultimately the message?

And yet, a bruised ego (which happens to us all, certainly me) can make us defensive even against things that, in our hearts, we actually support.

All I‚Äôll say is this: I can‚Äôt count the number of female friends and family (not to mention men), who have been assaulted in various ways by unhealthy men and their lack of emotional and spiritual consciousness. And when you look at hate groups, guess who‚Äôs leading most of them? ALSO men.

So we have to choose to be men who love and defend others fiercely and with a co-suffering attitude if this is going to change. I want to be part of the healing of the world, and I think most men‚Äîeven those who have taken this the wrong way‚Äîdo too."

And toxic masculinity is what got us here in the first place. You've got to be big hypocrite to say that this ad is saying shit. You need to start reading the newspaper for once, because sometimes all the internet does is echo back your own views and opinions to you, and you end up living in a bubble.

The whole point that needs to be driven into people here is that there needs to be fairness in the way we live. The point is not to do away with masculinity, it's to do away with toxic masculinity. The kind of behaviour that objectifies women, and teaches people to take pleasure in being ""superior"" (which we all know is how our ape ancestors talked 20,000 years ago)."

Then on the extreme end, Christians telling them if you like Hollywood you're going to burn in hell.

5323.0,,0,2019-01-17T02:52:39Z,"Well‚Ä¶. okay then‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. How about we make a commercial selling
some woman‚Äôs product that goes something like this.

Women, it‚Äôs time you start taking responsibility for yourselves
and not expect a man to support you and pay for you. Buy your own dinner on date,
pay for your own movie on date night,‚Ä¶.. and stop taking government handouts
payed for by hard working men‚Äôs tax dollars‚Ä¶. Support yourselves.

Women, stop raping men in financial divorce court‚Ä¶ and stop
lying to the court about how your husband abused you‚Ä¶. And stop trying to steal
his money, house, cars, pensions, and future income when you are divorcing him.
You are a woman, you don‚Äôt need a man, a woman needs a man like a fish needs a
bicycle, you can have it all‚Ä¶. A career and be a mother all at the same time
without a man or government handouts paid for by the tax dollars of hard
working men.

Women, stop cheating with other men (or women) behind r hard
working husbands back.

Women, stop whining and complaining about how hard your day
at home was while your man was working hard and sweating in factory all day.
Have his dinner ready for him when he gets home and get down on all fours and
put his slippers on for him.

The old societal model was:

A young woman would trade her youth and fertility
exclusively to only one man, and he in turn would be the workhorse and take
care of her when she gets past her prime. This was a great incentive for men to
work, become men, and get married. You got a prize, a young beautiful loyal
wife. In theory, as we know life isn't perfect. She does him a favor early on
by being a virgin/exclusive and later he does her a favor by staying and
supporting her instead of leaving her for a younger woman. They both get a prize.

The new societal model is:

Women whore around and waste their youth and fertility on
Chad/Tyrone, get walled out, get STDs, lose their ability to pair bond, rapidly
accelerate their aging process with excessive alcohol and fast food, and have
no loyalty to any man. What sensible man would pay top dollar for something 30
other men got for free? The incentive for men is gone. You don't get a prize
anymore. You get a parasite with an entitlement mentality that‚Äôs looking to
take your resources and then some. Before you even say ‚ÄúI do‚Äù at the altar,
she‚Äôs already plotting how to financially rape you in family court when she
divorces your sorry ass in a few years. Why do you think she‚Äôs smiling as she‚Äôs
walking down the aisle?

You're expected to pay a premium price for a used up, beaten
up, soulless woman from the bargain basement bins of some store in the hood
with the morals of an alley cat, an in denial, freak of nature, pathologically
delusional, self-esteem deficient, morally bankrupt, bottom dwelling, blood
sucking, inhuman, creature of the night, bitch on wheels, spawned from the seed
of Satan, and a boil on the buttocks of the world.

When she dies, the last living reminder of hell will be gone
from the face of the earth.

She has kids from Chad/Tyrone or both, personal credit card
debt, no assets, school debt for a worthless degree in liberal arts, no cooking
skills and no desire to learn any, no fiscal responsibility, an overly banged
vagina, and a pet you‚Äôll be expected to take care of as well.

And you're supposed to be happy about this opportunity to
lick up the scraps from the floor.

The so-called good men she wants and can‚Äôt find are out
there. They just don‚Äôt want her at the table because she has nothing to bring
except financial and emotional pain. In addition, she also has great
expectations you‚Äôll do everything for her, make her feel better, and provide an
unrealistic unsustainable life style she feels she deserves because she read
about it some feminazi magazine article that hates men.

All this while she cheats behind your back with the ‚Äúbad
boys‚Äù she really wants while you‚Äôre at work paying all the bills for this
little parasite.

Yea, that sounds like a good deal, is this the line I stand
in to loose half my sh!t?

Good luck with that.


Men are waking up and realizing this system is defective and
toxic. Women's sexual liberation, feminism and the birth control pill, have

It's just saying the norms of a Male dominated society in many cases have caused us as men to accept the unacceptable. And before anyone gets started, I am a man, a Marine Corps combat vet, a father and a husband. Instead of looking at it as saying we are terrible people, look at it as a call to doing the right thing for our sons, daughters, wives, significant others and those whom are oppressed by those who take advantage of others based on predetermined gender stereotype. Take up for our women. Protect the meek. The alpha Male doctrine is a myth. Even quoted as such by the guy whom came up with the concept. What is it to be a man. It says something about the people complaining more about the exposure of the problem than the problem itself. It's not saying men are inherently wrong, but that more should be done to uphold that that is right and just and we should be more at the forefront instead of trying to relive the ""good 'ol days."""

That's a weak fucking point.  Here's how you make a valid point:
(a) Why point out only bad behavior from men, and not women?
(b) Why can only men say something or do something when someone is behaving badly?
(c) Why do they think we're not doing that already, and that someone it's their idea to address people being assholes.  Clearly, judging by the comments, guys have no problem pointing out when someone is being an asshole, or a dumbass.
(d) It's a razor commercial.  No one wants to be lectured.  If someone is not doing anything wrong, they're not going to start telling other men what to do only because Gillette says so.  If someone is being an asshole, they're not going to stop just because Gillette says so.

5410.0,,0,2019-01-17T00:12:49Z,"1. From NFL to Hollywood to Gillette, the fastest declining industry in the West is the Woke Liberal Industrial Complex. 
2. The Woke Liberal supports destructive ideologies (i.e. socialism) in the morning, virtue signals in the afternoon, and demands handouts at night. 
3. Such rage over the toxic masculinity of conservatives on social media. Yet hundreds of women got raped by Muslims in Europe just last year. Rage about that. 
4. This world exists simply to satisfy the needs - most especially, the sentimental needs - of Woke Liberals. 
5. The Woke Liberal Industrial Complex is not about upholding social justice. It is about making themselves believe that they uphold social justice. 
6. The banality of evil transmutes into the banality of sentimentality. The world is nothing but a problem to be solved by virtue signalling. 
7. I deeply respect Woke Liberal sentimentality, the way one respects a wounded snake. You must keep an eye on it, because you know it's dangerous."

5420.0,,0,2019-01-16T23:52:01Z,"First of all, I'm a huge fan of your show Joe! Been watching regularly for about a year now and I absolutely love it!

But I'm honestly¬†confused about why the commercial is so offensive? I am a 22-year-old Male and seem the be in the minority here when I think that the commercial really is not that offensive. 

I am aware that YouTube as apparently been pulling dislike from the video and if that's true then that's definitely not OK! I am aware that this is probably an attempt to rebrand by Gillette simply to exploit what they presumed was 'popular' to simply make money. I am aware that some 'feminists' can use words like 'toxic masculinity' way out of context, stereotype¬†and blame an entire gender for problems that are not fair to men and seek not to gain equality but to actually harm and oppress men. I also understand how many groups freak out when they have stereotypes associated with them. And I also understand that it is a double standard¬†(if the video were showing women in the same light people would freak out!)¬†

That being said I think we can do better and not freak out at every little thing and set an example on how to take criticism. It appears that the commercial really only highlights a couple things, (Violent Bullying, objectifying women in the Media and Music, degrading women in the workplace, rationalizing negative behavior through dogmatism ""boys will be boys,"" and that Men should stand up when other men act in negative ways). These things are characteristics I think that are fair to associate with Men. And the commercial then shows that Men don't have to stick up with these things and can be better. The ad seems to indicate men that they can improve from these negative characteristics. Which I personally don't think is offensive.   

Love to hear other peoples thoughts and views! And I am honestly open to changing my opinion given new info"

,3440.0,0,2019-01-17T20:46:09Z,"@synthiandrakon Most people don't consider this, but commercials actually tell a small story and, thus, have an arc. Basically the story here is that most men are lecherous fiends who need to stop doing masculine things. Whether you see that in this commercial or not might come down to how well you understand the messages that are implied vs. the messages that are expressly conveyed vs. the story as a whole. The story arc of this commercial was seemingly built from such a distant and detached perspective that it is as if the people who developed it don't actually live in our society, or interact with others on a social level. 

The message that we are left with at the end has very little to do with stopping sexual assault and is more geared, instead, towards shaming masculine attributes; as if any and all masculine traits are inherently ""toxic"".

Whether you believe toxic masculinity exists or not (I do, toxic femininity exists too though) to frame all masculinity as toxic is a huge insult not just the male gender, but to the entire human race and all sexually reproductive life in the universe."

They get good PR with the SJWs, a card to use if someone accuses them of being anti woman AND if you look at Nikes support of Kaepernick and BLM their stock shot UP after that polarizing decision.

You really don't need these commercials to point out a minority behavior when the majority is already well aware that you should treat each other with respect and not to rape or sexually harass someone. All Gillette is doing is creating a marketing ploy to gain themselves attention on a topic that is currently a hot button issue via the media."

All I see in this commercial, is them trying to convince us that if we would be more civil and kind to everyone around us that the world would be a better place.

There was maybe one admirabal portion and that was the older boy helping the younger boy being bullied. That's it though. Do you even know the meaning of  objective? Heroism and evil deeds are not universally agreed upon, making them subjective and  based on the moral interpretation of the individual. Like I said earlier, facts related to things like science, mathematics, technology, epidemiology etc can be viewed as objective because they can be proven in one way or another.

All I saw was average boys and men exhibiting behavior that the average man/boy do not typically do. I never said it was an attack on white men either. I said it was an attack on men. What's the point of this commercial? Most men already know sexual harrassment and rape are bad. Same with boys. Ads and propoganda by the media keep blowing this shit up and it makes it seem like they think the average man has any control over what the weirdos in Hollywood are doing or that the average man does these things.

5562.0,,507,2019-01-16T20:36:08Z,"The problem with the commercial is it presents an imaginary man's world where boys are raised to think violence and sexism are virtues. Toxic Masculinity and Rape Culture are terms for made up concepts. Unless I missed Man School, none of us as a whole were specifically raised to think violence was a good thing. We were taught to defend ourselves not to be bullies. Most of the fiction we read and watch growing up is about heroes fighting bully-ish villains. Also in that fiction the main characters were respectful of women. But the caricature is that we are raised by psychopathic football coach dads who encourage us to be violent and to take advantage of women any chance we get (despite the reality of most young men living in fear of the overprotective girl's father)."
,3590.0,0,2019-01-17T18:32:14Z,"I feel like everyone (including my once admired Joe Rogan) are missing the point of this commercial. 

In the brief time the commercial has to quickly show the gamut of extreme examples (frat boys, Al Bundy's) to extreme Patrick Bateman type executive saying a seemingly inncousou (but we've all heard it) dismissive comment to a female coworker to the OTHER END decent guys like you and me who say stuff like ""boys will be boys"" without necessarily an awareness that our small comments could lead to big issues - perpetuating the very behavior that lead to douchebag guy stuff.

It seems A SAD AMOUNT OF males are taking offence when they don't need to be!  None of us like the douchebag male! But its not saying YOU are the douchebag - its saying that its not ONLY the douchebags that need to change!  Its big shit ass grabbing to small seemingly innocent shit!

Hell, Gillette even said (by showing their old commercials) how they directly added to the shit behaviors our society needs to get rid of.  They see the world is changing and they are stepping up and saying ""yeah we were helping to perpetuate this and we aren't going to any longer.""  Its not telling you to be a soy-boy (DUMB insult) or not be a man - its showing that we ALL may be complicit in ways we may not realize!  There's nothing to be offended by!

Its also not blaming ALL WHITE MALES so stop saying that! Its saying that if you are a decent guy regardless of color then to a) step up to men who are being dicks or they will continue being shits b) don't add to the behavior that you wouldn't want your own wife or daughter to be a victim of and c) remember that you can and should hold other men accounable. Women have been saying forever to ""please treat us equally"" so the commercial is telling DECENT men that they can do more than just agree that change is good by being PART of the change!

It has nothing do to with being a ""soy boy"" or not a man - its just being decent!

A ""razor"" company is saying this because they are recognizing that they added to the shit that we are in now!  And sorry Joe, but it IS a majority of men (lets say 60/40) - all you need to do is just look at our socail cuture for a day and see what gets hits, what brings in all the ad revenue and who those customers are and maybe try to imagine how they behave elsewhere and its pretty easy to see. 

I think people who are so offended need to look at why.  If you're not a dick than the commercial is basically saying ""continue not to be a dick and try to persuade other guys not to be dicks too.  Even if it doesn't help now it may help in the future. Kids watch us so be a good example so they will grow up to have less dickish behavior then the generation before them."

I believe most men believe rape is a horrible act and so I dont believe that 25% of women have been raped that's insane I mean even if you wanna say there are serial rapists which there they would have to rape a lot of women to get to that point and I dont believe our society is that fucked up that women are raped at such a high rate.

 Btw I personally dont think 25% is such a staggering percentage that it makes it unbelievable. Like if I gave you a 25% chance on a bet you probably wouldn't even take it cause its so low.  Also I dont think its specifically college women. Most from what ive researched happens before."

Do you think when I get done with my 7 hour day from my college classes I go with my ""boys"" and say ""Oh just another day of raping. I love doing it. It's a great part of our culture."" No one says that ever. A rape culture is that rape is accepted or celebrated. When that Stanford kid got off with 6 months men and women were outraged. That alone is proof that we do not live in a rape culture. No one thinks rape is okay except maybe for the people who do it, which is a super low percentage of people. I mean how high could it possibly be of rapists? Probably 1% or less of men. There are serial rapists for sure but no one says that those men should get away with that ever. We're like 10 years past the old excuses like ""what she was wearing"" if not further past that than that. We do not live in a rape culture. Stop pretending you're oppressed because you're not. If women couldn't succeed in America there would be no rich women. So stop it with this oppressed bullcrap you can be as successful as any man or more successful than any man. The only thing holding you back is you pretending you're oppresse and can't succeed because of it."

In a world where an the system is working against men, being a MGTOW is the safest choice. This is not only about the recent move by Gillette, this has been going on for quite some time and men need to wake up to the reality.

The reality is that men as a whole are being portrayed as bad in movies; men are being accused and having their careers destroyed often without a due process; men are being divorce-raped in the courts - depriving them of their assets and children.

So wake up, fellow men - especially if you are younger and not yet screwed by the system - and start paying attention. Start educating yourself about the situation like your life depended on it - because it does. Tuning in to Coach Greg Adams and Terrence Popp on YouTube is a good start - these guys have been through the meat grinder and have stories to tell.

Maybe it's me, but I can't quite bring my self to take the ethical moralizing of a faceless multi-billion dollar conglomerate who for decades (and still today) champions commercials with square jawed muscle bound athletes and dashing corporate raiders winning over scores of gushing, sexy, scantly clad bimbos through their gorgeous shaves seriously.

We don't have to agree for us to have an exchange of thoughts in a civilized manner.

I get your point of view, and i agree that Gilette focusing on men makes sense. But they should'nt even go there. Three years ago they were sponsoring a large lightly dressed bikini girls team during a car race. Girls that men could drool over(something they would call ""Toxic masculinity"" ) and now they're the ambassadors for men? Give me a break... 

The society we live in now has never been so polarized. Between woman and men especially. 
This commercial that simplifies a problem into a large community of ""toxic"" barbecuing males, Where a majority of them are the same bad apples, does nothing other than polarizes between woman and men even further. 

When they generalize a whole group of unique individuals into a collective where everyone is the same, they just create frustration and anger.

,3660.0,0,2019-01-17T20:21:58Z,"@Andreas I don't know.  I can't say I agree with your overall assessment, but I genuinely appreciate you laying it out honestly and respectfully.  

Where I think the distinction lies for me is that this company and more broadly just people in general who are addressing this phenomenon,  are saying we should amend masculinity which is toxic.  These responses appear to be coming from people who are responding to a statement more akin to we should amend masculinity, which is toxic.  That comma is a small, but largely important piece of punctuation.  It's the difference between saying that maleness in its own right is bad and saying that dudes acting poorly devalue maleness.  

As for women being toxic as well in their own ways, sure, that case can absolutely be made and made competently.  But Gillette has not positioned itself as a brand this way and thus that critique wouldn't make much sense when taken in the context of their slogan ""the best a man can get"".  They are clearly going for a ""the best a man can be"" angle here, which for better or worse does not necessitate tackling all social ills in one fell swoop."
,3661.0,0,2019-01-17T19:36:05Z,"@David I hear you.
But what the backlash really is about is the newly invented term ""Toxic masculinity"". Just another term invented by the third wave feminists to bash on men.
Sure, men can be toxic. But women can also be toxic. There are toxic behaviour that any human being on earth can possess. The gillette AD is but one of many campaigns driven these days against men.
It's not that the ad asks men to be nice that is a problem. That in itself is of course a good message. To stop bullying is also a good message. There are of course some messages in the ad that are good. But in the larger scope, this ad suggests that all typical masculine traits are toxic.(not only the examples above)
It basically suggest that masculinity is toxic and femininity is superior. This is something that should not go unchallenged.
In my humble opinion, both the masculine traits of men and the feminine traits of women should be praised."
,3662.0,0,2019-01-17T16:59:36Z,"@Andreas This video is the only thing I know about the ""backlash"".  But YouTube is something of a recursive echo chamber, so I'm not sure how to gauge it.  Personally, beyond the way in which I agree it can and should be lampooned or dismissed (that being P&G is a comically unfit messenger for this type of statement), I couldn't really give a shit one way or the next.  It's an ad.  So what.  If I'm being honest, though I am not sure upset is the right term, I am frustrated that there is a contingent of people for whom this is apparently not only important, but a priority, sure.  I can agree with that.  Life would be a lot better if those types stopped existing by one means or another."

Yeah, you know not to be racist, or sexist, or misogynist, but there are a lot of people in the middle who see all of those things happen and do nothing. 

The commercial speaks more to them than you, and you can't say that there aren't men who don't need to hear the message of this commercial.

ripped to shreds.

blowing people up...

I am also tired of being told that masculinity is inherently toxic and 
we need SJWs with humanities degrees telling us how to behave.

though just being a man in of itself makes you likely to be a harasser 
and an abuser so we need constant guidance and hand holding otherwise we
 will just walk around being misogynistic by default."

Being a man is not being a douche bag and sexually harass a woman or beating up a smaller kid in school, but standing up against what is wrong. Remember the cowboy and martial arts movies, John Wayne & Bruce Lee didn't go around beating up small kids for shits and giggles or grabbing women by the pussies.  They showed us change what one man can do to protect values of freedom when enough is enough. It takes a man to stand up against a group of guys to say no more or leave her alone.

The problem with this specific commercial is that it never identifies that they condone people‚Äôs behavior which applies to all people of all genders.

It's like Nike with Kyle Kappernick, Nike doesn't give a shit about black people getting shot. What it cares about is money and it did a calculation that showed supporting Kappernick would make them more money and it's the same thing with Gillette. It made a calculation that if it attaches itself to this issue it will make more customers than it will lose, and they're probably right despite the frenzy happening right now.

People disillusion themselves that corporations care more about social justice and care more about people than they do about a profit. They make money. They aren't good or evil, they aren't humans with emotions. They goal is to increase the bottom line - that's all it is. Look at how Trump helped that one car company, how proud he was, only for that same company to move to another country some months later. He and his base were all outraged and betrayed. $$$. That's all it was and that's all this is. $$$.

The very things that make good men good are now being thrown onto the bonfire with silly childish bullshit like ""cat calling"" and ""wolf whistling."" Perhaps the biggest problem with playing with the fire that is ""toxic masculinity"" is that it literally has different meanings to different people, and thanks to how stupidly nebulous that term is, there is no legitimate way to separate those meanings from each other.

We live in a world where these things exist.

I also find it a bit Ironic given Gillette's historical marketing practices to attack masculinity. They have primarily used masculinity and sex to sell products in the past. Do the people attacking masculinity realize that masculinity is the reason we have civilization? Men acting and feeling like ""men"" are the reason why we have cities, cars, aircraft, etc. It's the drive to create and improve, to one up the other guy. 

Okay men! You are already on the internet. Assert your masculinity and kick Gillette to the curb!"

Why are people so offended by this commercial? It is asking men in general to step up their game when they witness an injustice from bullying or misogyny.

,3826.0,0,2019-01-17T15:16:46Z,"@Jake Hahn It definitely is a part of masculinity though, its just when it goes a bit wrong. When femininity goes wrong it looks different to that, although not completely. insecure people tend to be more aggressive and need to tear down people they feel threatened by, no matter what gender they are. But there is this image of a man as a lone wolf maverick who never shows emotion and is mildly psychopathic.  If you are comfortable with your masculinity you can see that this is a construct for telling stories, but if you are insecure and searching for a way to prove to the world how tough you are, you might end up taking this nonsense seriously.
All the men that I know who are really on top of their game, are relaxed open people who are not judgemental but will always step up when there is a moral wrong. 
There is too much arbitrary bullshit attached to masculinity by marketing companies. Like eating beef is more masculine than eating chicken. its all nonsense, and if anything every single mass market food product aimed squarely at men will end up making you fat and full of oestrogen. 
I am ranting a bit, but all this outrage over an add that is telling men to man up and confront behaviour that we all know to be wrong, just shows me how many insecure and manipulated men there are out there. 
But also, I do hate being lectured to about anything in an ad by some giant corporation because they want to make out like they aren't total c##ts."
,3827.0,0,2019-01-17T14:20:56Z,"Kebo Boke That‚Äôs a really good point. I suppose I‚Äôm just cautious of the seemingly negative use of the word ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù, because it seems to be getting diluted and misrepresented. I think there may be far better words/terms to describe the type of person(s)/behaviors you‚Äôve described than to attach such negative connotations to masculinity. Maybe ‚Äúanti-masculinity‚Äù? Those behaviors are highly immature, and truly developed masculinity is far from immature. I believe there are males who treat others well and there are males who do not. But to attack a beautiful thing like masculinity isn‚Äôt the accurate thing to do, because with enough repetition and exposure to the term ‚Äútoxic masculinity‚Äù there‚Äôs a good chance that society will begin to see ‚Äútoxic‚Äù as synonymous to masculinity."
,3828.0,0,2019-01-17T06:57:34Z,"""If you're truly masculine then you're not toxic"" Isn't that the point? Toxic masculinity is when men are overcompensating for some failing in masculinity, real or imaginary.  It makes them act like aggressive assholes and project their insecurities onto others while being overly sensitive to criticism. ¬†
Short man syndrome was the most commonly understood version."

,3839.0,0,2019-01-16T15:06:46Z,"I agree, but also have to disagree with the fact that men manipulate just as women do, that is not true at all. Women are master manipulators compared to men, some men attempt it and often use it simply to get into womens' pants but women are often far more nefarious in their manipulations. Same with lies, a lot of women today have no issues lieing about being raped when the guy may have been ""simply"" harassing them or something, which is bad, but then falsely accusing them of being rapists is insane and should be taken as seriously if not more than actual rapists are due to the fact that this being recognized as being so widespread is actually hurting the cases of actual rapes nowadays. People need to be actively deterred harshly so as to set an example when abusing these issues to get rid of competitors, their bosses or simply guys that ""offended"" them.

And no, we are not all accountable. The only ones accountable are the perpetrators and the administrations of schools for example, that lets bullies go unchecked or simply brush them under the rug whenever an incident occurs. Stop pushing the blame on anyone outside of these groups, the supermajority of people are against these issues and do not let the perpetrators continue unchecked. Rapists are effectively destroyed socially, even before actual evidence has been presented which the cancer that is ""Me Too"" has exploited."

 Unfortunately it will come across to our generation as a hate act

6132.0,,0,2019-01-16T09:45:27Z,"So, I wanted to see what the controversy was about. What is all the fuss about for people to boycott Gillette? Are people actually feeling so sensitive that they‚Äôre getting offended by this ad? All I see is that, the bottomline message is to encourage men to lead by example to hold each other accountable and courageously speak up and step in, when you witness behaviors that show signs of bullying, creepy objectification of women‚Äôs body, glorification of sexual harassment / violence, trivializing assault, defining ‚Äúmanhood‚Äù as aggressive behavior, or blaming the victim. There are plenty of masculine traits we all admire, such as absolute certainty, being trustworthy, decisive, confident, responsible, protective, logical, hardworking, empowering, and plenty of other noble masculine traits without being an asshole that belittles others and demeans women to make themselves look powerful. Do some men honestly feel attacked about this ad? Maybe the ones feeling attacked actually have something to feel guilty about?"
,3860.0,0,2019-01-16T17:16:23Z,"@Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus I think I see where you're coming from, but please correct me if I am wrong. I dislike being labelled, to be generalized in a group. The ad makes you feel being lumped together, with all men oversimplified to being put in a box. However, from my perspective, I don't see the ad is trying to portray that. 

I guess the ad, just like any books such as the Bible or any piece of artwork, is open meant to invoke emotion, and the meaning is interpreted by the viewer. We shaped the world largely due to our own personal experiences, and we take away the message based on how we interpret the ad. 

The reason why this ad is perhaps well-received in certain aspect (even though I think the overall execution could have been done better), is that women feel empathized or reassured that a someone with power or status (such as a celebrity or company) is speaking up and taking a stand, to make a voice known in a way that perhaps is more difficult for men comprehend because they've never stepped into the shoes of a woman. If you ask a women in your life how likely it is to walk across a crowded bar/club without getting groped, how often it is to walk down a street without worrying being stalked or followed, or how frequent it for women to received unwelcome sexually explicit comment or touches, or how many women in our lives that have been harassed or assaulted... It may not be a daily worry of yours because it never happens to you, but ask any women in your life, ""How often it is do you worry about your safety?"" Chances are, it's pretty often. It could be as simple as walking back the the parking garage from your office. Just few weeks ago when in Chicago when I was walking to an item delivered next to an Amazon mail box, I was scared because a guy followed me for 3 blocks, and he lingered by pestering me with sexually suggestive questions and inappropriate remarks that made me feel uncomfortable when I was at the Amazon locker. After retrieving the items, he followed me for another block away from the gas station, and I felt so relieved when I got back to my Airbnb. 

The feeling of our safety being jeopardized can happen quite often for a woman, and I think the objective of the ad, in my opinion, is to challenge boys to become men, to have the courage to act as role models for other men, to step it up and help other if you see inappropriate behaviors of violence, harassment, or misogyny. For example, one of my friend old me when he was in college, his guy friend would have such ""locker room talks"" in a networking social event. One guy would point out, ""Hey do you see those group of girls over girl wearing short skirts? They're just asking for it. I'm just gonna go over there and get them drunk and give it them."" The other guys laughed. My friend didn't say anything, and stayed quiet to himself even though it bothered him. He told me in that in that moment, he could see that they were capitalistic and opportunistic, and made the demeaning comment inflate his ego. However, if it were to happen again, he would have stepped in and said, ""Hey man, that's not cool. I don't appreciate that kind of language and that kind of assumption about those women. Cut it out."" I feel that the intent of the ad is to encourage men to be accountable for other men, to challenge them to rise up on a higher level to be more decent human beings."
,3861.0,0,2019-01-16T10:03:02Z,"The problem with the ad is that it isn't the venue to address such things. It is perpetuating a movement to disenfranchise and marginalize men, especially white ones. The idea that a company that markets products to men should lecture them is self destructive. The huge majority if men are not doing anything wrong. The phrase toxic masculinity is being thrown around everywhere which is communicating that they should feel ashamed by manhood."

Some of the comments that you find funny are a reaction to over the top virtue signalling by opportunistic corporations who in all actuality give zero shits about leftist causes  except """" can we profit from this or not?"". I personally think boycotting is fuckin stupid no matter what side of the political aisle and companies should focus on selling their products regardless of the demographic or personal beliefs not peddling politics and alienating whole groups of potential customers. That being said, recent history would suggest that boycotting and doxxing are favorite tools of the progressive Left used to punish  or strong-arm individuals and corporations to toeing a particular political line or social cause . Saul Alinsky would be proud of the Left were he alive today. To tell you truth  I can't wait to see how this current position we find ourselves in turns out and it will not end well.  It's hard to deny the similarities between the current sociopolitical situation and the Wiemar Republic and I think we all know how that turned out.

But fortunately, there are some, within this societal disease of maleness, (who are either confused or vindictive enough), and willing to engage in the tactics employed in this very commercial, accusing all men of these reprehensible behaviors and impose the proper amount of shaming and waging of false accusations to set the rest right. We want more of these men, who will accuse everyone they disagree with of some manner of bigotry& or harassment most foul, to shame every male into the mental state we believe they, as men, deserve.

The entirety of this video was the cliffs notes for an ideology that has been corrupting institutions of higher learning across the country. In this ideology, there is only power, all interaction throughout history is a battle between oppressor and oppressed, specifically of one group oppressing another. Men are the worst opressors in history, and all men today are the beneficiaries of this oppression, all are guilty of some reprehensible behavior simply because they are male, and that's all that matters. I have to draw the line somewhere, this is it. We should take a page from the playbook these bullies use to censor any debate they disagree with, use our market power as the primary customers of this company, show that we Will not sit by and be accused of  vile acts of a small number of those who happen to share our gender.

,3921.0,0,2019-01-16T15:33:28Z,"The issue is lack of masculinity today. What is wrong about a guy approaching a woman he finds interest in? Nothing at all, unless he goes ""dayum dat ass doe"" or something similar.

The majority of men today are raised by mostly women, yet we blame masculinity for these behaviors, why is that? Are women imprinting this version of toxic masculinity in men? When actual Men were in their positions the result was mostly chivalrous men, why is that? The removal of men from the raising of children and childrens' education is the issue today. Men as a whole are doing a damn fine job, better than we have ever been, yet we can't ever catch a break can we? The biggest issue today is that the pendulum has swung so far that women are the priveleged gender today and still attempting to cry wolf about anything that occurs. Stop blaming men for all social ills' and attempt to work together instead of attempting to shame men simply for being men.

 The pendulum has reached the other side an yet it is continuing on, attempting to go all the way around instead of naturally ebbing and flowing, that is the issue. Stop trying to force all solutions to be on mens' shoulders and actually and actively work with men instead of against them all the time. How do you think this would work if we attempted these same arguments against blacks for example? Constantly shitting on them on the basis of their race instead of actively trying to help their communities as a whole? The issue is that people have to be wanting to get helped aswell, and when you start shitting on men for being men all of the time from every angle perceivable then ofcourse we will get offended when we are not even to blame.
 Men have been pointing out issues that men are facing for decades and yet are all the time either ignored or called sexist for simply attempting to start a dialogue about our issues, that have more factual evidence than these issues being peddled here. A lot of the things in that video is not even an issue. Why is it an issue if a man is attempting to approach a woman he finds interest in? How the heck are people supposed to interact? Can we even interact? How would you make any friends, get into relationships etc if you can't even talk to a stranger? Nothing implied that he was going to be improper about it other than the fact that he found her beautiful which apparently is a bad thing today.

Boys fighting is not an issue either, as long as it doesn't get too physical. Boys are different from girls and are more physical by nature, stop attempting to feminize the boys, just as we shouldn't be treating girls as boys either. Intervene when it starts going too far and not before. Bullying is an issue of both genders and while boys may physically harm people, girls are masters at psychological bullying which can be far worse. An asskicking will heal in time, some mental wounds are forever if they dont outright make people attempt suicide. Both of these deserve to get taken as seriously as the next which is why this commercial is a bullshit attempt at trying to bring light to the issue and that is why people are upset. No one disagrees with the messages, we just are tired of the hypocrisy that is at display here, attempting to put it all on men, when even most men are against these issues. The perpetrators won't change anything because of this video, and it only attempts to guilt innocent people into feeling that they are inadequate and can do more. This also is not an issue of masculinity either, there is nothing toxic about masculinity just as there is nothing toxic about femininity. It is select people of both genders that are fucked up, not the genders or our natural inclinations as a whole."

I really enjoy Joe Rogan's podcast.  He's a superb entertainer, he's incredibly smart and very well spoken.  This is right up there with the most disappointingly short-sighted take he's ever had.  ""They made ever guy look like a misogynist asshole.""  Watch the ad again, Joe.  That's patently false.  They show several situations that, until fairly recently, were either brushed under the rug or seen as completely acceptable.  They never said ""ALL MAN ARE EVIL ASSHOLES AND MISOGYNISTS AND RAPISTS!!!""  Moreover, a good part of the ad focused on speaking up if you see another guy being a dick, or intervening if you see your kid being a dick.  WHAT THE FUCK IS SO ABHORRENTLY WRONG ABOUT ANY OF THIS?  God this clip bummed me out so much.   Ugh.  Theo Von, who is insanely funny and talented, asking ""will men even have dicks in the future,"" and Rogan  incomprehensibly ignoring his ability to analyze the ad objectively and rationally in favor shitting all over it immediately.  I couldn't make it until the end, but I would be willing to bet the word ""pussification"" is used at some point in the clip.  

Yes, it's a little heavy handed.  Yes, it seems disingenuous simply because it's a company whose bottom line is making money that's putting out the message.  But are we really, REALLY shitting on a company that goes off the beaten path with an ad campaign that's aimed at bringing awareness to a movement that will result in fewer assaults, fewer instances of bullying and fewer rapes? ¬†

If you need to act like an abusive asshole to feel like a ""real man,"" newsflash, you're not a ""real man.""  You're a monumentally insecure mental midget who lacks the intelligence and maturity to process your feelings like a goddamn adult. ¬†

But go ahead with your ""boycotts.""  I'm sure you all were wheelbarrowing stacks of cash, gold coins and rubies from your Scrooge McDuck vaults and spending every last farthing on Gillette razors.  And now without your mighty, oh-so-manly support, Gillette will be faced with the decision of groveling at your Air Max 90's for forgiveness or filing for bankruptcy and fading away into obscurity. ¬†

Madison Avenue NYC used to be the epicenter for all ad agencies. Hundreds of them. However, for the past several decades they have been systematically bought-out and incorporated into only a small handful of agencies that control 90% of the world's advertising. This is why we see ads that always feature white men as being idiots in nearly all commercials for nearly every product or service advertised via mainstream communication. A product or service does not get sold anywhere unless it goes through an ad agency. And all of the ad agencies follow the same antiWhite male agenda as does the mainstream media and Hollywood. They are all fellow travelers. And they hate you, Joe Rogan!

6324.0,,0,2019-01-16T06:08:37Z,"While I appreciate Gillette speaking out about something meaningful, aren't they supposed to be selling razors?? The commercial uses a very advertised base philosophy in which they project this ad will help ""change the world"". People get hair on their bodies and some of those people will want to shave it. That's pretty much all Gilette needs to cover. Also the company is clearly speaking to someone that is not their target audience. It's safe to say that men are the ones who mostly buy Gillette razors, yet this marketing campaign chooses to disingenuously demonize them. Looking at statistics, in North America almost half of men grow up with a single mother and almost 80% of teachers and social workers are female identifying. This ad more so leads to the conclusion of a lack of strong male presence able to provide guidance and teach responsibility to younger males. What is happening instead is a bigger presence of peer influence that is leading to toxic masculinity. This merge of masculinity with toxic masculinity is quite dangerous. But for Gilette, I guess any publicity is good publicity.  *shrugs* p.s. Shaving is totally a gender construct so to be rid of that, let's just let hair grow free! I certainly won't judge üòõ"

If we're just going off personal experience, the first 17 years of my life were in rural Kansas surrounded by sexist, homophobic, racist assholes who thought their opinions meant they were smart enough and didn't need to consult experts or read before making up their minds. Then, more recently, the 6 years I spent in the air force, before receiving an honorable discharge, were inundated with toxic sexist, homophobic and racist work cultures and many sexual assualt cases and I'm talking about from just the units I was a part of. 

You're willfully blind or blissfully unaware if you don't think men need to do a better job at setting a higher standing and holding each other accountable. 

Is it silly that a razor blade company is making this point? Yeah. But maybe if we made the point, this ad wouldn't be so groundbreaking."

Someone who is experienced in marketing and doesn't destroy your brand in one advertisement. 
The fact that their allegiance is attacking their own customers gender shows that they have lost the battle against Special interest groups and allowed themselves to be shown as a

How about two women prisoners who raped and butchered a man here in Ohio. They invited him to a hotel for a three way. When he was spent (they had him tied up for ""pleasure"") they shoved a pen into his urethra, and continued to rape him all night. Then the one girl thought the other girl was in love with him so she killed him chopped him up amd threw him in the woods behind the hotel. Where was this in the news? Oh that's right nowhere.

I wonder if a lot of them just didn't hear the word toxic that was at the beginning of the add, and are thinking that Gillette is saying being (just masculine) is bad.

It's the obnoxiously aggressive drunk you cut off that's waited behind a parked car for you to leave! Oh, jeez! The paparazzi? I'm a celebrity?!? Nope. Single mom, hoping this entitled idiot doesn't kill me before I've gotten to teach my smart, funny 5 year old son to NOT act like THIS! And then there's the ex's who give you the parting gift of a pair of black eyes, a broken nose and, in his words, 'Some a' that good d!¬©k, so you don't forget what you're giving up, you stupid, ungrateful ¬©~¬¨t!' Ironic that I was leaving after discovering he'd lost his job weeks before and had been giving that  'good d¬°¬©¬•` to someone else while I was @ work...he didn't get that ""we are woke"" man memo, I suppose. Anywho...the vast majority of the male population are decent & mostly respectful pervs. Good fellows, who may lack quality communication skills, but are, for the most part, good sons, brothers, husbands, dads etc. I'm hoping most of them don't choose to be all judgemental, macho and offended by that Gillette commercial (and enlightened men are probably unaware of this) but there are a couple, few of your brethren who didn't recieve that memo on decency and respect. And how would they ever know they shouldn't beat, rape and/or kill women unless they got the memo? Or someone taught them? Or...say maybe they saw advertising that clued them in on those subtle points of societal norms and human dignity. But that would never work, so don't bother with that shit?

Please name a jew who is trying to subjugate gentiles on behalf of the Talmud. There are jews who do bad things and those who do great things, same for gentiles. Was Jonas Salk an ""elite"" jew? How about Einstein. I doubt that Einstein based anything he did on the writings of the Talmud."

Responsible gun ownership is something that definitely needs to be worked on, yes. That doesn‚Äôt just go for little billy. The VAST majority of gun crime in the US is gang related. As for the opioid crisis, it‚Äôs time we decriminalize the vast majority of drugs and completely rethink the way we treat addiction. Vancouver tried a study where they freely gave drugs with clean needles to anyone who wanted them in a controlled, safe setting. I believe Sweden did the same thing. Opioid deaths plummeted to the point where they were almost non existent. Joe Rogan had Gary Johnson on his podcast a couple years ago and talked about it. He can provide the statistics. It should still be on YouTube. Feel free to look it up.

Women say hi to men all the time and it is no problem. Literally everything you peeps are projecting was even shown in the commercial. It showed very basic things and condemned them. Two boys roughhousing. Boys chasing another boy, iust like in real life an adult stops it. Already a norm. Nothing new. The guy saying HEY to a girl and being stopped? Why? why was that wrong? Do you think a woman cant handle a man saying hey to her? Stfu"

But the truth is that we're actually mad at the people that made the commercial on the marketing team trying to spread their messages with the commercial instead of advertising their product, just like We prefer to hate the person that pulled the trigger than the gun itself."

The only way to send the message to corporations that we don't want their ideals and morals on the side is to stunt their financial earnings in the same way gamers are with BFV and the like. Hurt them in the wallet and other corporate entities will see that this is not the way to go and just sell us their product.

You and every other fright-winger did what the marketing team over at Gillette wanted you to do, give the company more attention and boost profit margins by having whiny lonely idiots give them free advertising. This commercial garnered Gillette *10 times* more views, and literally *1000 times* more consumer interactions than their previous most popular YouTube advert (the gel deodorant) by the hivemind of internet intellectuals who got triggered because a commercial said ‚Äúmen should hold shitty men accountable.‚Äù 

Gillette was getting its ass handed to them by Dollar Shave Club and similar products for about a decade now. They were irrelevant. But because you angry internet boys couldn‚Äôt separate themselves from a commercial of shitty male behaviors, you legionaries gave them endless amounts of free publicity and exposure while stepping in line with the idiots blaming ((the juice)) and AAH THE LEFT because a commercial made you react. Want to talk about ‚Äúhijacked brains‚Äù? *You‚Äôre literally talking about a razor and deodorant company because of an advertisement.* They fucking fish-hooked your entire base into being their advertising pawns.

But evolutionary psychology explains why it's even stronger in women.  That was useful in forming early societies, but in the age of mass-media & consumer culture, it's gone into overdrive.

,4468.0,0,2019-01-16T04:10:16Z,"@Jared Pahl - These companies know that women are _more_ than 50% of their customer base, since most consumer purchases are made by women.  And women are even bigger social conformists than men, often basing their desires off of appeals to emotion & what they perceive to be popular among other women.  So if women do most of the shopping & are more susceptible to those ploys, it makes sense to market to them.  

One of the dirty secrets of 3rd wave feminism is that a lot of this crap is being orchestrated by advertisers who just want to make money by manipulating women into thinking that they're ""empowering"" themselves by purchasing certain products, services, etc.  

It's how the women's magazines, shows & websites work: they covertly make women feel bad about themselves by forced comparison with gorgeous actresses & women with ""amazing"" lives, but then claim to be there only to help women (""How to look great this summer!""). 

In reality, it's in the company's interest to kiss women's asses while _subliminally_ attacking their self-esteem, so that women feel desperate & insecure enough to need their advice, service, product, etc."

And there will be no going back. Because we, we believe in the best in women. women need to hold other women accountable. To say the right thing. To act the right way. Some already are. In ways big and small, because the girls watching today will be the women of tomorrow_"

If 1 out of 5 women were raped in college, since there‚Äôs 10 million women in college, that would mean 2 MILLION women are raped on college campuses each year, just in college ALONE. What parent would send their daughters to a place where 20% of women are raped?? No women would attend college if 20% of them were raped each year on those college campuses. 

If 20% of women who shopped at Wal-Mart was raped, nobody would dare to show up at Wal-Mart let alone continuously to shop knowing that women are getting raped day in and day out in the aisles of Wal-Mart. College campuses would be no different.

The FBI statistics show 6 per 1000 women are raped. If 90% of raped go unreported, that would be 60 per 1000 which is still nowhere NEAR 1 out of 5 women. We have to get our facts straight before we can get to the truth and solutions. 

Finally, rape is prosecuted at the same rate as every other crime so that means if we live in a rape culture, we also live in a theft culture, a murder culture, a DUI culture, etc.. That or we don‚Äôt live in any and all of those acts are condemned by society at large."

It also says that masculinity is toxic, again not true, toxic people are toxic and that includes tons of women who are feminine.
Basically they are saying all men are bad and should become feminine soy boys.  
Furthermore the ad should include everyone, like toxic women that make false rape aligations or women that ruin peoples lives with lies and rumors. Just as many women are bad people as are men and that`s why men are so outraged at the ad, because they are making it look like women are all good and men are all bad."

,4606.0,0,2019-01-22T18:00:50Z,"@NoHandsJames You conveniently ignore the point that an ad of this sort targeted toward women would be considered outrageous and unacceptable, especially coming from a corporation that makes razors for women. Gillette does make those you know. So when can we expect a comparable ad targeting that audience? Exactly. Never gonna happen.

I just came from a boy scout trip with boys play fighting and it was a lot more rough than what is shown in that commercial. Yeah the men stood there and watched. If it had turned to a serious fight we would have stepped in and not because of some stupid razor commercial admonishing us. I guess we aren't real men in your book and you would prefer we nerf the world including ourselves. Again, it's not gonna happen and it's way out of line for you or Gillette to suggest that this normal and healthy male behavior is unacceptable. It simply isn't your place or theirs. At least in your case you aren't stupidly costing yourself millions of dollars by offending your customer base. Gillette is.

Concerning the man approaching the woman there is no way at that point you can predict what his approach would be. 
Are you really one of these types that would step in front of a man who merely begins to approach a woman as if you're some white knight out to defend women even when they haven't asked you? I doubt it. If you are then you probably get your ass kicked on a regular basis."
,4607.0,0,2019-01-19T00:52:52Z,"@dutch1999 okay so your first point is just blatantly ignoring that the slogan is ""the best a MAN can be"". Why in fucking hell would a commercial centered around a phrase about men ever be targeted at women? Do you really think that's a logical point to bring up? 

Secondly it isn't a fight, it's clearly shown as play fighting. That is until the end where the boy on the bottom starts looking pained and like it's no longer playing, which is when it shows the adult step in. There's nothing wrong with that, nor is there a reasonable way to say it's wrong to step in when a kid is going too far. 

As far as the guy trying to ""approach"" the woman. The look on his face was like a fucking animal stalking prey. He wasn't trying to hit on her he was going to be a fucking creep and that was evident by his expression. If he had started to approach her like a normal person, then it's a different story, but with they way he began doing it they were clearly showing a situation that anyone would know to step in at. 

Once again, if you find a problem with any of these messages, you are a fragile disgrace of a ""man"". If you can't take a fucking commercial calling out shit behavior, especially if you don't take part in it, then YOU are the issue. Unless you're going around doing the toxic behavior they're calling out, you have zero fucking reason to be offended here."
,4608.0,0,2019-01-19T00:18:35Z,"@NoHandsJames Well for starters it associates bad behavior with men. They aren't making a commercial directed at women who engage in online bullying even though we know that is a problem. And they won't because that doesn't fit with the feminist agenda of demonizing men. Secondly, some of the behaviors they show are not necessarily bad. The kids wrestling around on the ground, that's a normal and healthy form of play for boys. Now maybe they just did a bad job of portraying a real fight but then if it had been a real fight between kids it would have been very inaccurate to show a bunch of grown men just ignoring it. That is not a normal thing for men to do. But if you're a man hating feminist you might think it is. The guy that saw the woman pass by and went to talk to her also was not a good example of bad behavior. It's not bad behavior to approach a woman you find attractive. Again maybe just a poor portrayal of harassment but that would be two different cases of poorly showing bad behavior. Then we have the selection of white actors portraying bad guys and blacks coming to the rescue of white women. That was not accidental. So the ad isn't only sexist it's also racist. And why is a razor company even doing this in the first place? This has nothing to do with selling razors. They are way out of their lane and this would spark outrage if the targets were women or minorities as well it should."
,4609.0,0,2019-01-19T00:05:39Z,"@dutch1999 what part of that is twisted masculinity? Being a good male figure to a child? Showing self control and not being a creep?

The only way you are offended by this is if you're a fucking blathering idiot who still judges how much of a man they are by beating on their chest like a fucking primate.

,4610.0,0,2019-01-18T23:54:00Z,"@dutch1999 how is it a radical feminist view?

It then shows older male figures stopping said bad behavior and champions the action to show young boys that masculinity is also about self control. So where is any of that a bad thing?

,4611.0,0,2019-01-18T23:49:12Z,@NoHandsJames The only way you aren't offended by this is if you were raised without a masculine role model and buy into the twisted feminist concept of masculinity.

,4621.0,0,2019-01-16T16:48:29Z,"I have spent far too much time thinking about this today. It has been a day of long high speed train rides to and through France, so I have had the time. After some evaluation and research i think if they had really wanted to reach men and empower men to ‚Äúbe better‚Äù or ‚Äúthe vest they can be or whatever, they would have started with acknowledging all they do and simply shown examples of men setting an example, also in regards to standing up to each other when they treat women poorly.

The more I have been thinking about this the more I wonder if the result they got wasn‚Äôt exactly what they expected and part of a strategy. I started googling and found some thought pieces to support this.

Men are wearing more beards. Disposable razors are a shrinking market. Sales ro men have gone down about 5% a year for the last 5 or so years. Women shave a lot but often don‚Äôt splurge that bit extra for a gilette razor (legs and armpits versus face, whatevs...). But if they make women feel supported maybe women will start paying the dollar or two extra for Gillette. If women do that, they don‚Äôt need the shrinking male market as much.

I was surpised by the male backlash, maybe because I don‚Äôt live in the US and the Dutch would be unswayed by this, but I am guessing it is actually predictable. Gillette got the controversy and attention they wanted. This was a strategic play on their part and a smart one.

That said, people react to the intention with which you do something. They feel your actual purpose. In that sense, the backlash is well deserved and men are reacting the only way they could . They are being used as pawns to win the feminist market. The commercial pretends to be speaking to them but it isn‚Äôt and that is strategic. P&G is not stupid and their PR team knows what it is doing. They are playing us. And I guess we could say I got played too. 

Of course, men want to be better men and protect those they love and be sensitive to others‚Äô needs. And suggesting that they don‚Äôt (both try to do this and do it) is insulting. So, yeah, maybe the reaction we are seeing isn‚Äôt ridiculous as I initially saw it. Maybe I was just naive."
,4622.0,0,2019-01-16T16:30:40Z,"So you admit it was poorly done lol...it‚Äôs no different than any other ‚Äúnot all *insert noun* are bad! There‚Äôs always a few bad apples in the bunch argument. I just know whenever conservatives bring up possible issues in specifically the African American community and Islam it naturally reverts to ‚Äúoh that‚Äôs racist‚Äù and ‚Äúthat‚Äôs islamaphobic‚Äù and then bam back to square 1. Same for liberals who call out when white men and shootings and then conservatives start getting defensive so the point being whenever any group gets called out they hate it. It‚Äôs just reality. Just silly to think in 2019 lecturing campaigns from Hollywood/liberal outlets telling a specific group to change would go over well lol. The whole metoo movement was pretty much started by Hollywood men not being able to not rape women/kids ie roman polonski, Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby, Kevin spacey and the list goes on yet for some reason they feel whenever they have an award show they need to get on their soap box and tell us how to live our lives. Meanwhile most of them knew this shit was going on for years and didn‚Äôt say a damn thing (see feminist Meryl Streep) yet there she was championing the metoo movement at the oscars. So if you‚Äôre gonna make a commercial attacking the truly toxic people of a specific group you might wanna start with the origin not middle aged dads at BBQs and kids rolling in the grass. I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs just a tired and played out act that we are sick of. If you don‚Äôt follow politics I could see how you would think the commercial is good intentioned but when you think of the bias and hypocrisy that went into it and tie it all together it was bad execution.

Could it have been better? Less moralistic? Maybe tempered some if the criticism with a bit more feel good recognition of all giys are already doing? Probably. Did it warrent a backlash this intense and over the top? Not in my mind. But clearly a huge segment of the population feels unseen and unfairly judged.

I, and most women, love masculinity. But not toxic masculinity (just like there‚Äôs toxic things women do too) Yes, men will still have penises in the future, sex drives, be strong etc, but they‚Äôll hopefully be more respectful, cautious, gentle, and use their strength to stand up for the people who are not as strong as them.

It‚Äôs 100% possible to be any political affiliation, any level of intelligence, any background, and actively choose to be the good kind of masculine. Start today in whatever social circles and communities you‚Äôre in.

I definitely think that would have brought more credibility to the ad.

Thanks for bringing this up. Women have a lot to do too. I think the commercial wanted to focus on men doing the right thing though, not women. But they should have shown women also occasionally adding to the problems that some/many men are actively trying to fix.

Your dislikes and comments about hurting me on my videos do distract from your credibility and good points. But it's alright, I still should acknowledge this comment because I do think it's a good point."
,4631.0,0,2019-01-17T02:22:27Z,"Well a lot of people had some choice words for me. That's ok, I wish you realized I'm on your side. Of course there is toxic femininity and ESPECIALLY toxic feminism. But my point isn't really about toxic masculinity...my point was that I think a lot of people misunderstood the point of the ad...it wasn't saying at all that men are bad, but applauding men and saying there are good, strong, powerful men sticking up for people weaker than them.

One person made the point that the commercial mentioned ""some men"" implying a minority. That's actually a really good point. They should have said ""many men"" or ""a lot of men"" instead. However, read some of the comments made towards me and maybe add up how many use derogatory words. Regardless, I still like to believe the majority of men are the good guys shown in the ad.

Some people mentioned ""what if tampax made one about toxic female things!"" and I have to say....they did. in 2014. It was Always, another tampon brand.

 They showed teenage women being told to do actions ""like a girl"" and the girls acted lazy, lame, weak, etc. It made girls look bad for a second. Then they showed little girls being told to do the same things, and they showed determination, effort, strength, etc. 

The point of that commercial was to say ""do better, women. Because you are better. See? You're amazing and powerful and can make awesome changes!"" ...Which was the EXACT same messages, in the same order, geared towards men in the gillette commercial. 

I saw the commercial and my first thought was ""I love men!"" I think a lot of people are really missing the point/main concept of the ad. I didn't like the commercial because I was happy they said men were bad! ""yeah men suck!"" ...no, I liked it because it made me appreciate the awesome strong men who have stood up for me or protected me in my own life in various ways.

(Also, they showed white men stopping bullying/harrasment too (barbecue, boys chasing scene) and black men doing the wrong thing too (black dad at barbecue, black guys about to fight). But maybe they should have made a more even split, that is a fair point.

Thanks for taking the time to read. And super thank you to the nice guys in the replies."

If you became an adult male in 90's and later, your highly emasculated.

You americans, have not even started yet.

Th ptb need american males, for there wars, thats why you lot over there are still so sexually up for it still, lol. You lot fight the wars for the anglo american elites, so thats why you still have not been emasculated.

I'd like to point out that it's those statements that lead to the alt-right white is Right Pride. I'm not saying Tgeo himself or Joe for that matter, but this p*** me I've been stereotyped incorrectly, is how it all started in the first place. While real minorities are discriminated against daily and much more egregiously. I'm a 42 year old white woman and witnessed a customer berate a Bengali teenager and threatened to break them in half buy a Bosnian immigrant. Racism comes in all packages no matter their color or race and religion. But I'm not subscribing to this Bill Burr what's the matter I'm just an angry white man attitude, that's what's fueling our racism here in America!

How is a commercial about men standing up for what's right so triggering? I guess people just see what they wanna see or what's on their mind.
,4719.0,0,2019-01-22T18:08:17Z,"@HAS Portraits One need not assume all men. It is evident that Gillette makes the assumption it's a sufficient number of men that need a lecturing about how to behave that they felt the need to use their marketing budget to that end. I think that assumption on their part is far from reality. I think this issue is more complex than they make it seem. That this ""metoo"" thing includes a lot of women that will outright lie about sexual misbehavior and use it as a weapon to destroy men. I think women use their sexuality on a routine and widespread bases and then complain about being sexualized when it is convenient and they feel they have something to gain. Gillette's portrayal doesn't address any of that and of course they won't because it's easier to just engage in cheap virtue signaling. It was a stupid move on their part and will cost P&G revenue but I guess at least the handful of people at Grey Group who created the ad can pat themselves on the back about how virtuous they are while accomplishing absolutely nothing substantive on the issue."
,4720.0,0,2019-01-18T23:38:49Z,"@HAS Portraits There are a lot of assumptions built into that premise. Remind me again why it's the business of a razor company to lecture men on what ""true"" masculinity is and how they should and shouldn't conduct themselves?"

I'd love to hear the person who wrote this break it down and rationalize why they'd do such a stupid thing. For me.. idk I'm lost as to why so many are focused on the fact that a bunch of dads stood by watching kids fight and are upset by the idea that it makes them look bad rather than inspired by the fact that among these men grilling there was a man who stepped up to correct the kids behavior and teach them to be nice. It just won't compute for me so I guess I'm stuck on this island
,4723.0,0,2019-01-16T02:36:30Z,"@Jordan Bennett Jordan, there is a lot of imagery in there that is not bad guy behavior or mentality, but deminishes tradional male roles, like demonizing the rows of guys barbecuing.   Bro. I can tell whatever is said your mind will rationalize away from the island where you have a legitimate point.   We have all lived there at some point but its immature.   Critical thinking has to be able to go inward to show us where we might be affected by influence, ego, etc.  It's what makes us different than women and not simps for the type of manipulators that made this commercial.

It's an unfair sweeping generalization that the far left is known for doing. The MeToo movement is evidence of that.

No one gives a shit if it was about women hitting each other. Since when has the media treated women on women violence issues seriously? The sensationalism value had always been targetted at men being accused of abuse towards women even if it isn't even proven in the court of law."

,4735.0,0,2019-01-16T00:00:10Z,"The problem with the ad is that it suggests that the majority of men are bad people when infact the opposite is true, only a small percentage of men are bullies mollesters etc and most men are good people and never mollest anyone. 
The other issue is it`s racist, they only show white men doing bad behaviour and the black men coming to the rescue to stop them.
It`s racist and sexist and very offensive to the average man that prides himself in treating women good. 
The third problem is that it says masculinity is toxic which is so fucking ridiculous, toxic people are toxic and that includes tons of women. A man can only be masculine or feminine, they want men to be feminized soy boys, this is why men are outraged, because we are being attacked for being men, there is nothing wrong with masculinity and we are sick of the attack on men!!!"

BUT, like I said before Gillette is in the business of making money (like any business), and they‚Äôll do anything to do just that. That‚Äôs where co-opting social justice for their ads comes into play.

To be honest, I actually didn‚Äôt really care about the actual video itself. I just thought: ‚ÄúOh look, another corporation co-opting serious issues to sell product.‚Äù I think that ultimately it‚Äôs up to the individual to decide whether or not a brand supports their values.

It's nothing more than a desperate attempt to buy yourself emotional stock and make you seem like some saint. Unfortunately, I don't give a shit who you're married to, and ""disabled veteran"" doesn't make me stand up and salute. You're no less a a moron. If you go back through my comments, I only focus on how you're an unintelligent little turd, I make no assumptions about your family or your love life. You on the other hand, because you lack intelligence or any basis for a real argument, go straight for the low hanging fruit. Predictably. You imply I'm gay (happily married to  woman), and slandered my father several times. My father was actually an amazing man who just recently died of liver cancer. Didn't mention that before, because just like me with your ""disabled veteran"", why the fuck should you care? Also I just assumed you'd say something like ""He probably killed himself because his son is a pussy"", because you are that predictable.

,5070.0,0,2019-01-16T02:19:48Z,"@calebd512 Can you provide an example of how this isn't an ad against men's masculinity? It plays the common feminist rhetoric that ""men interrupt women"" ""boys shouldn't be roughhousing"" ""men shouldn't stare"" which they all stem from masculinity,  and if you can't see how this is a downright insult to men's masculinity I don't think you will ever change your mind.

What do you think this ad is meant to inspire men and boys? Meant to spread positivity? Do you honestly think that everyone who hates this ad hates it because it tells men not to sexually assault or interrupt women and not for the fact how a majority of the advertisement is spent criticizing men's masculinity? 

Also, the company ""P&G"" have been deleting dislikes and comments on their video, as of this comment right now over 50,000 comments have been deleted. This is evident by how it's number 6 on trending but most top comments only have 15 to 20 likes.

If I spent 1:09 out of a 1: 48 advertisement criticizing womanhood, saying how they all turn on one another, how they're uncooperative or any other meaningless stereotype but make the last 39 seconds saying ""sexual assault bad"" it's suddenly free from all criticism relating to the previous 1:09? Also, I will admit I do believe I have the moral high ground over you but that's mainly your fault. 

""na fuck you punk bitch you're not shit and never will be.""

You claim you have been talking sense this whole time but all I can see is spammed nonsense.

Also, people would complain if it has naked women and violence the UK straight up banned extremely beautiful women from ""Is your beach body ready?"" Commercial and billboard and it even put a few women out of jobs. 

These people aren't upset because the ad is telling them not to rape, they're upset because of how this ad portrays masculinity in a negative light when it is one of the fundamental supports for a society.

I know that this comment will get the attention of those who feel that I'm wrong but, I know for a fact that any negative comment won't be from a real man. To those who understand, to those who are tired of hearing about who and what a man should be and to those who support and are men.

309.0,,8,2022-08-14T17:03:11Z,I bought a $10 safety Razor and one box of blades for it 3 years ago. After 3 years I am about to run out of blades. This commercial has saved me hundreds of dollars on Gillette products by pushing me away. trust me guys just try the safety razor. it's a little bit more difficult to use and takes a little bit more time. but it's worth it you'll say big bucks and you get a closer shave.
,385.0,0,2022-11-03T23:49:20Z,"@Gary Patton No, it's not. Safety razor is an outdated ancient technology and this is the reason no one is using it anymore. If it was so great how come most men including our fathers and grandfathers moved on from it? Stop telling yourself these rationalizing lies )) I used to shave with a safety razor and it was pretty bad. I would never go back to it."
,386.0,0,2022-11-03T17:18:00Z,@John Dong I honestly don't think I could go back to a normal razor. It's just so much more comfortable with the safety razor. I imagine it's more environmentally friendly too. Rather than waiting for the plastic to break down the metal blades will simply corrode away in a really short period of time. Even if I put a fresh blade on every single day it would still only cost me $20 a year and create less waste with a better quality shave. You got to admit that's pretty impressive. I wouldn't necessarily call it ancient technology though it's the same concept as any other razor. Lol

Are some misandrist women afraid of blind men, disabled men, feminine men, gay men, injured men, limbless men and old men. These types of men are not a threat to girls, women or to anyone else who has this delusion to think the ultimate lie of thinking men are dangerous. Not all able-bodied straight men are dangerous to girls and women because if you think this way then you are possibly mentally ill plus you are paranoid. I know for a fact that there are many incredible women in this world who support men and they are not afraid of them because of their gender. These decent non-sexist women see men as human beings not as predatory monsters. I know for a fact some women not all but some can behave horribly because bigotry, bullying, sexual abuse and violence is not a male behaviour & it is not a female behaviour it is a human behaviour. Any human being can be a violent monster period regardless whether they are a female or a male. We men are not demons and thugs we are human beings with emotional feelings. Not all men are the same because if you judge people based on their group identity like class, gender, health, language, nationality, race, religion and sexual orientation then that makes you a bigot period. As human beings we should all follow the three principles of life compassion, empathy and love to have a more perfect union."

For example masculinity has been celebrated by the fire department, the military, the police academies and other organisations to protect the world. When it comes negative toxic behaviour like abduction, bigotry, bullying, emotional suppression, murder, physical assault, rape, riots, sexual assault, torture & war it is called abuse not toxic masculinity. Being toxic is not masculine it is called abuse period."

The issue I have, is that I don't think you really understand female nature.

""Empowering"" women, is merely giving them the ammunition to give them _new_ ways to make mens life even tougher than it already is.

Feminism IS toxic - it is _not_ about equality, it is about the promotion of unhindered female nature - which has been relentlessly shown to be an insurmountable liability to men, women, and children.

This is an easy way to discern the reality of female nature:

Put *yourself* in the position of a (particularly modern day western) woman - doing ALL the things a woman would do during the course of the day, addressing matters in the way a woman would, and communicating with men the way they would.

It becomes quickly obvious, what that feels like, and what you are aware, it is doing to other people around you.

Also, put yourself in the position of the woman, when the man - eventually - tries to solve a problem, without you reverting back to being a man.

If you've ever heard of MGTOW (Men Going Their Own Way), you will find *exactly* how ""toxic"" the men there are, and how toxic women _actually_ are (a good 99% of the time)."

Susanna Reid is *perfectly* capable of not speaking, but won't, because of the threat of losing her position of (artificial) entitlement.

If men get together and start joining the dots, they will uncover exactly how they've been sh*t on by feminism and everything associated with it, particularly since the 1960s.

Women will lose their hierarchical position (which oftentimes was obtained through unethical avenues), and will have to accept what they always were - property of their fathers, then property of their husbands.

Female nature isn't a ""fixable"" problem like certain demonic possessions or taboos - it just is, what it is.

 I'm pissed to see how we will put the young boys down in the forthcoming years by telling them that their nature is toxic. I believe there is a lack of masculinity, otherwise, politics would be braver and men would easily jump to someone's help if needed. Because men are already sensitive, we already cry when we are broken, we are already shy when a beautiful girl looks at us, but some feminists spend so much time spitting on us that they do not even understand how the other sex works.

All the examples of masculinity shown in this ""news"" piece were of healthy masculinity.
After 30 years of applauding masculinity it is ridiculous to think they have made a 180 degree turn.
Gillette highlighted examples of toxic masculinity.  They did NOT imply that all men are that way.
In fact, what they have done is appeal to all of the nice guys they've been celebrating for years to speak up when they see abuses happening.
It would be folly to try to get the ""toxic"" few to change by sending an ad out to them...
It's disheartening that a ""news"" person could be so emotionally blinded by his own reaction to anything that his ""reporting"" could get as biased as this.
Terrible job.

But it does not say men are evil by nature. But some people seem to be offended by the fact that the ad showed those acts as negative behaviors. If you  think doing those things are part of being a man, you got a serious problem."
,111.0,0,2019-06-10T21:29:22Z,"It ASSOCIATES these things with men, therefore implying it's inherently ""male"" behavior. 
Women bully MORE than men, which has been proved repeatedly. Catcalling is done probably more by men, but I've honestly seen it done by women almost as much in my experience. And I also don't think it's a big deal. Harassment also mainly affects men, statistically speaking. So there's NO fucking reason to associate these things with men or masculinity.

But Feminazi's don't understand this and would chemically castrate us all regardless to get rid of such impulses. 

Aggression ? Might lead to bullying, might lead to someone unable to stand and watch as he see's injustice pass before him and drive him to take action, leading to what men have always done, put themselves in danger for the benefit of others.

And, the fact you immediately dismiss those stats above because they don't agree with your world view shows just how blinkered you are.

Piers was spot on in this video, and anyone that has any sense of reason will see this plain as day. That ad is an attack on men through and through. And, I'll even link you a little clip showing some of the additional insidious editing they did too, just to really make sure they were hammering the point that it was white men as the source of all evil:

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAJdSq16cnI

You probably think it's a lie that men suffer basically just as much abuse as women too, as shown in multiple reputable studies (and we all know fine well that's even given the absolute fact that women are far, far more likely to actually report such things)--yet there are around 2000 shelters for women and 1 or so for men. That probably even sounds fair to you, that women get the vast, vast, vast majority of help and support, even when both men and women are suffering equally in this area (which of course you won't believe or accept).

You, imo, are probably the kind of woman eluded to in this video:

https://youtu.be/3WMuzhQXJoY

But, I expect you to argue with everything single thing I've said, of course--and actually believe it's because you are the one who's ""fair"" and believes in ""equality"" and are only doing what's ""right"" by us ""all"".

Because that's how man-blaming ""feminists"" who don't realise they're man-blaming ""feminists"" think and act.

Sometimes--and you're clearly to blinkered to even realise this simple fact--shouting is actually warranted.

Finally, here's the best example of all your hypocrisy: You call Piers an overemotional bumbling moron--for being a man showing emotion and anger at injustice and basically just insidious bullsh*t--but just imagine if that had been a women making such a fuss about how some wrong was being done to her and how you would have perceived it and responded to it. . . . I bet you certainly wouldn't have used one of the very abusive slights that has stopped men from talking out about all this abusing and attacking of them for so long now: Because clearly any man that talks up about this kind of issue is, in your opinion, less than a real man--an ""overemotional bumbling moron"". Oh the sheer irony of it all.

You can't even see that it's people like YOU that are part of the problem, trying to basically excuse every wrongdoing by anyone you side with and dismissing anything that goes contrary to what you already believe to be ""true"". You're a femin@zi NPC who can't see she's a femin@zi NPC. And those are the real dangerous kinds:

The ad was produced by an extraordinarily talented feminist film director, Kim Gehrig, for women, repeat for women. And Gehrig has brought almost all women together with
this commercial.¬† Did you really think Gillette would choose a feminist to sell to men? ¬†That is idiot thinking.

This was a well thought out strategy by Gillette management, just like the Kaepernick commercial was well thought out by Nike.

Why would Gillette want to appeal so much to women?  Women pay substantially more than men for equivalent Gillette products.¬† The higher prices for female products, often called the Gillette ‚Äúpink tax‚Äù, provides a much higher profit margin from women customers than men.

Gillette is willing to lose some male customers to win far more female customers with muchhigher female profit margins and thus earn higher profits.¬† This is called a gambit, and it can be an extraordinarily effective business strategy.

Please let me walk you through what Gillette is doing by explaining the Nike success.¬† Remember the uproar and planned boycotts when
Nike initially announced it was using Kaepernick in its commercials?¬† And yet the Kaepernick commercials were enormously profitable for Nike.

Nike knew it would lose and win customers using Kaepernick.¬† 

What Nike correctly projected was that the customers they would lose were cost-sensitive and low profit-margin customers (mainly white and older males) and the
customers they would gain would be higher profit-margin purchasers like African Americans and youth.¬† It was a gambit that worked big time.

The Gillette commercial will also work big time because women view this commercial as helping them, and those opposed to the commercial as the
Neanderthal thugs stereotyped in the commercial. ¬†Look at all the female comments about ‚Äúif you do not understand the commercial, you are the problem‚Äù.¬† Most women do not care about
negative male stereotyping and shaming in the commercial, and women are more than willing to pay the Gillette ‚Äúpink tax‚Äù to support Gillette in its efforts for its ‚Äúkindness‚Äù to women.

Yes, Gillette will probably lose some male customers, like me and some of you, who believe the negative male shaming is unhealthy for men and women and negative
stereotyping should not be done against any group in America.¬† Nevertheless, women do not see the problem with stereotyping males because they are not the ones being stereotyped so Gillette
will gain many more women customers from the ad than they will lose male customers. 

Remember, men, here is a simple rule for future advertising--fat shaming is bad, but male shaming is good.

Are there other advantages for Gillette beside profits from the ad?¬† Oh yes, like a magician uses misdirection, Gillette uses the ad to misdirect socially responsible people (1) away from
discussing Gillette‚Äôs use of child labor, (2) from the Gillette ‚Äúpink tax‚Äù, (3) from much better quality and lower-priced razors from competitors, (4) from Gillette‚Äôs
inappropriate sexist imaging of women (remember beautiful women in really tight blue jump suits with ‚ÄúGillette‚Äù written boldly on their butts?), and (5) from Gillette‚Äôs
parent company‚Äôs (P&G) testing products on animals.

With a simple ‚Äúabracadabra‚Äù, the Gillette magician has ‚Äúpoof‚Äù moved the discussion from Gillette toxicity to ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù toxicity.¬†

No one is talking now about Gillette toxicity.¬† In a way, I would like to stand up to Gillette‚Äôs toxicity, just like Gillette demonstrates in the commercial.¬† But no
one can effectively stand up to Gillette at this time because Gillette has effectively misdirected the entire world away from Gillette‚Äôs problems.

Gentlemen, do you still think that I am wrong?¬† Well, here is a big clue for you.  When corporations make big mistakes, the best practice is to always quickly
apologize for the mistake and to always quickly do whatever it takes to make amends.¬† Gillette is not apologizing because they know that they are going to make a fortune from this ad.

Instead, Gillette simply says that they are just trying to ‚Äúhelp‚Äù men become ‚Äúbetter‚Äù people, and who can be against that?¬† Watch how Gillette also now responds to negative comments by saying that ‚Äúmany‚Äù men are helping (when the ad emphasizes only ‚Äúsome‚Äù men are helping)‚Äîagain, a masterful use of quick misdirection).

Gentlemen, even if you hate the negative male stereotyping and male shaming in the commercial, as my Granny used to say, you still have to give the devil his due.¬† Like Nike, Gillette will make a fortune from this ad."

Gillette has allowed itself to enter to a very strict space which is reserved to family members while growing up. No parent teaches their children to rape, sexual assault or violence. A man at his 25-30 has already formed his character based on the values his family taught him or his own experiences and will not change much for the rest of his life. If he does is only because of a life changing experience but definitely not because of a gillette ad.

The arrogance of gillette to think that can enter this space is the offending part. Gillette is not a family member, it is a razor's company and should stick to razors."

And its one of many different things that appeal to my interest. But why wouldn't understanding women appeal to me? I'm instinctually sexually attracted to them. 

So I've spent time on investigating their nature to increase my possibility on getting sex with them but also to protect myself from their mysterious and unpredictable natures. And with that, I've found out what they're really like and what motivates them which has majorly disappointed me about them generally as people.

See, the thing I've figured out about women over the years is, whatever decision they make is based on what they want for themselves...they're not bothered about anyone else. So let's use your example. She'll have a real genetically masculine boyfriend who's probably an alpha (I've not checked this either but I reckon you're right). But because she's got that covered in her own life because that's what she's attracted to, that's all that matters to her so she wants the rest of the world's population of men to be beta male simps so that her every beck and call in whatever situation outside of her relationship is covered 

Feminism is another example. It's based on women being motivated for themselves. They're not really bothered about other women's rights. Just their own. But they have to persue the supremacy of women in general in order to get what they want out of it and they use other women to give momentum to their own cause. If they were honest, they'd rather have special treatment, exclusively for themselves, regardless of what happens to the other women. It's self activism rather than group activism. In reality, if they could persuade everyone to just give THEMSELVES exclusive supreme rights as individuals, they'd scrap feminism in a heartbeat. They're just too 2 faced to admit it."

Beards have nothing to do with masculinity and all these ‚Äúmovements‚Äù.

You wanna blame anyone blame the Women! They know exactly what they are doing. Trying to get noticed, setting up ‚Äúmeetups‚Äù aka Prostitution. Setting up pages to earn money through go fund me pages, Setting up Amazon wish lists to get free stuff sent to them. Women thrive over the attention and thats what they get.

The one thing I failed to understand is that why men are so offended by the message?! It wasn't a personal attack on 'men' or 'masculinity' rather it was identifying the 'abusive behaviour by men'. Just have a look at the responses made by ""men"" ( I think most of them are young lads dominated by hormones rather than brain if they have any!) here and compare that with yours. What would you call them? What has triggered their ""masculinity"" to act and behave and response the way they did? Lack of intelligence? lack of education? Is it lack of emotional intelligence? Lack of communication skill? No man becomes a monster in isolation. Then what are the factors that create monsters in our society? The commercial is simply touching upon the problem that exists in every society and raising awareness about certain behaviour and actions done by men. What is SO offensive about that?!!"

You stated that ""35% of women has been sexualy assaulted"". That is factually incorrect. I fact-checked the link you provided. 

The 35% lumps in sexual violence AND physical violence experienced at any point in life. Also, the 35% includes women who experienced sexual or physical violence at the hands of other women. The 35% does NOT represent sexual assault by men as you claimed.

In fact there are both films and commercial showing the toxic fiminine side. Just look at Snickers commercials. 

I don't see denigration in this ad at all. 
""It's also saying that for two or more boys to be roughhousing is inherently dangerous behaviour that needs to be avoided at all costs, when in reality it is part and parcel of the developmental process of any healthy boy.""
Please sight a scientific paper that support this postulation you are making. Also, I don't see that at all in this ad, that kids can't be physical, just that when things go to far, it is time as a parent to step in and explain a few things, instead of saying "" boys will be boys"".

35% of women has been sexualy assaulted...overwhelming minority of men did that? 
http://www.unwomen.org/en/what-we-do/ending-violence-against-women/facts-and-figures
But to answer your question: No, I expect that this commercial and other voices will show men that it is okay to stand up to bullies and tell their kids not to bully others....also, I expect them to get publicity and sell more of their product, that is what an ad is supposed to do. They have succeded with the publicity. 

I like companies that are social conscience. I wish more would be like that, not only in voice, but also in actions. However, if I can't get the action, I'll take the voice over the silence and complaisant. It is okay if you don't."
,333.0,0,2019-01-22T09:01:36Z,"‚Äã@cute face 
Some keep saying that. Never explaining what we are not getting. That standing up to bullies are a bad thing, seems to be the message of the Piers Morgan-types. You are right, I don't get why they believe that is a good message."
,334.0,0,2019-01-22T08:59:22Z,"@Pyladin The thing is, it's not just saying that.  Take a step back and look again.   
It's also saying that to be attracted to women, and to want to approach them, is pathological and toxic and an aggressive act of violence in and of itself.  
It's also saying that for two or more boys to be roughhousing is inherently dangerous behaviour that needs to be avoided at all costs, when in reality it is part and parcel of the developmental process of any healthy boy.  
And it's also implying that the kind of toxic behaviour supposedly demonstrated in this ad is somehow unique or uniquely prevalent amongst men, whilst in reality it's an entirely open question whether its extreme masculinity or extreme femininity that is most destructive societally.  

Just imagine if a Tampon company tried to convince women to avoid the evils of toxic femininity (conniving social manipulation largely, an anti-social consequence of the extremization of the natural feminine strength of interpersonal adeptness). This would never happen in today's Western world, as men (largely white men; watch this ad again more closely) are the last social group that it is still widely socially acceptable to openly denigrate.  

And then there's the very obvious point that immediately strikes anybody who spends even minimal brain power considering the advert: Do the designers of this ad expect for the genuinely toxic and pathologically aggressive and violent men (an overwhelming minority) who actually exist out there to see this ad and then suddenly change their ways?  An utterly misguided ad indeed.

And they used scenarios where men were involved in little sketches to show men how they should be acting but aren't acting enough like that. They are saying that generally, more men need to change, which is pretty insulting because it's implying that most men are bad in some way shape or form. That's nothing like the shit that feminists jump on. Feminists jump more onto men presenting a mostly positive stereotypical view of women, which more often than not is justified. Or they jump onto men objectifying women when the women they claim are being objectified, are voluntarily putting themselves in the limelight to be objectified. The difference is, men are defending themselves against their nature being attacked whereas feminists are not defending women. They're attacking men at any opportunity and labelling it as defending women, when men are encouraging women to be women, but for some reason that's bad."

But this advert is strongly implying that men are generally bullys and that they harass women. Which is not true. And a large proportion of men who take control of the actions of women (who they regard as bullys) or men who pursue women intimately (who they regard as harrassers) bring it on themselves. Men are instinctually dominant, controlling and sexually motivated if the right buttons are pushed. And women push those buttons too well. But they complain after they've lead us into it."

Starting to hit is easy. Controlling yourself not to hit, is hard, is tough. Be a man, don't hit.

But i'm not so hooked on stereo types, so that is why i write ""manly"".

Also, it seems that people don't understand commercials. They are not going to show a kid hitting another kid. It is implied that the kids are not playing. That one is not having fun. One is being hurt. Just like they are not going to show people having sex and full on penetration. 

Let it be the woman's choice, not ""yours"", if the want to work and have kids. Else, maybe let the man be the one at home? Loads of kids misses their father and would be a good thing to see them. Also loads of fathers would love to be at home. That is another toxic thing: talking down to men, that are home dads or telling women that they are bad moms, because they are working.

I am have been bullied in college because I was too weak to stand for myself. I thought ignoring it was going to help but it only made it worse. Eventually I did get help by another friend of mine, who by the way is TOUGH, I mean the guy will literally beat the crap out of you IF you piss him  off but he is very empathetic and I repeat EMPATHETIC despite being ""Masculine"" . That said, Masculine men aren't bad, it only depends on your intentions as a person. I am still polite but now if anyone pisses me off, rudeness will be the last thing they will see."

,408.0,0,2019-01-21T21:05:57Z,"@Varun Sawhney I agree that it was badly executed, but it is a minute something long ad aiming to get a response so the goal it's going to have to use short cues to get an emotive response. Hence the ""not cool"" dude is an unrealistic situation in that he stopped that dude before he had actually done anything but does get the point across because it was designed to look like this dude (Im not sure why you mention race but I assume it has context for you) was going to be a little shady, although who hypothetically knows. I don't like linking play fighting or running or dancing with girls with toxic masculinity, these things are great and don't hurt anyone. That's bullshit and I totally agree with you there. I disagree that it paints all men as bad, I just don't see it. And I've got nothing against the words at the end, we can do better, every single culture in the world can do better and there isn't any shame in that. My only point is that I, as a dude, don't want to be affected by the shitty details that society's traditional gender roles involve. This shit is why dudes kill themselves so often and it drains the joy out of life (a weird example from the gym yesterday, I have a friend not working his hip adductors because someone told him these exercises were feminine exercises. Fuck that noise, get gains, bro). And all of the women in my life deal with creepers all the time, and cat-calling, I have a friend who gets sexually assaulted so often that she didn't even think of it as sexual assault until we had a conversation about it and I was like ""wow that's 7 years in prison under the crimes act"", and she's not an isolated case. My point is, badly executed ad, but the cultural conversation we are having right now I can't help but see as a positive. I just want the people I love to be able to both feel safe walking down a street at night and have good coping mechanisms, regardless of their genders. Thoughts? Do not mean to ramble (I mean I let it happen but) and seriously only wish you the best dude so please forgive me if anything comes across badly. Thanks for explaining your perspective.

It's shows boys running in the house, or fighting in the backyard as being toxic. It shows boys tearing a poster and running, it shows boys dancing with bikini clad girls as negative. It assumes that the white man is going to stalk the women!! Why can't the man just be walking up to talk to the woman. The other guy comes immediately saying "" not cool""?
The entire tone is negative and lecturing.. it's top down lecturing all men, telling men how to behave. It paints all men bad.

Should we not as society strive to be better to one another, to be a better man, to be a better person to ourselves, our families, our friends to others?

This is not a commercial about shaving or selling more razors as much as it is about the piss poor state of the world and a society that has become increasingly more violent and aggressive. People are becoming more dumbed-downed, desensitized and accepting of whats wrong.

If by doing the right things in life, by standing up to say Enough! gets you so up in arms to spout more hatred! Really? Maybe YOU are a part of the problem?                                                                                                             FANTASTIC commercial. I hope it gets major air time.

,487.0,0,2019-01-21T15:39:07Z,"@TooManyAnimation ""Because it isn't a thing"". Because your fellow sheep don't bleat that phrase. You must realize how poor of an argument this is.
Now go ask the KKK if blackness is toxic. Go ask a Nazi if ""Jewness"" is toxic.

Newsflash: German soldiers in the early 40s were NORMAL PEOPLE, just like you and I, who were possessed by the dominant ideology at the time. Don't assume that every phrase you hear enough around you and becomes ""a thing"" isn't absolute bigoted horseshit. 
Stand up for common sense and treating people as individuals, not parts of a vilified collective."
,488.0,0,2019-01-21T15:19:46Z,"@TooManyAnimation The funny thing is that none of that eliminates bias. You can read the questions that they asked which is where the disingenuous nature of the survey is. If they had asked simple straightforward questions like have you ever experienced sexual assault then they would have some weight in this discussion. But the questions were not straightforward and open to a large degree of interpretation. By their standards if you were 17 and a boy asked you for nudes and you weren't quite sure of it but you answered yes in the ""made you show your sexual body parts to them?"" question, then that would have been assessed as sexual assault. 

But you're right that did take away from the main point. And the main point is that the situation is so nuanced and complicated that neither you or Gillette have even began to scratch the surface of it. You're not helping at all tbh. But neither am I really. Lets face it, parents don't teach their children any of these things. Nor or any problems experienced in society solely perpetuated by parents or in terms of the commercial, men. So in the grand scheme of things if you're all about being progressive, the Gillette commercial really does absolutely nothing but tell us things that we already know and things that most of us already don't do."

I am fact checking my dude you are providing me with 0 sources for your arguement, despite saying your facts have been proven which has gotten off of the main topic anyway being that the Gillette ad isn't an attack on me, it's just saying sexual harassment and bullying is bad and that it should be stopped when seen and you should show your kids that because kids follow by example, it's not saying that men are innately evil and HAVE to be told to not do these things it's literally saying ""Teach your kids how to be good people k?"""
,492.0,0,2019-01-21T02:57:33Z,"@TooManyAnimation  They're quoting statistics, because they didn't actually do the statistical work themselves in that regard. So that isn't a valid source. You can scroll down to the bottom and see the various sources they use to accumulate their information, some of which use wholely exaggerated methods of question and answer to achieve their desired results. You're obviously offended because you think I'm belittling sexual assault which I'm not. Similarly to the 1 in 5 college statistic which was proven to be 1 in 52. something. Of course that is not an acceptable number either, but it is nowhere near as an epidemic as the 1 in 5 and 1 in 3 statistic insinuates. When will people like you realize how easy it is to manipulate numbers in turn to manipulate people like you who fact check nothing.

Again this isn't to belittle sexual assault, it's more to belittle people who spew faulty information to manipulate others and people like you who believe it without a doubt in your mind. For reasons that don't make any sense. Even presidents of nations use faulty statistics to further their own ideals but you think organisations wouldn't either.

It is a minority of men who have no fucking regard for your teaching and indoctrinations that do these things but yet OUR ENTIRE fucking gender has to be made a complete show out of to tell us this. Because apparently I didn't know beating the ever living shit out of my girlfriend was wrong until mighty Gillette told me it was.

I think the problem isn‚Äôt so much that it‚Äôs a ad from a man mostly product, although that does add to the annoyance of it all, but it‚Äôs the fact that they are trying to say stuff like all men, and toxic masculinity and a lot of words that rope in all men into one category an say fix yourselfs. Most of the issues u brought up u said our kids but the commercial and the ads say our boys and our men. Do u see the difference? U sit here an say the ad points out how our boys need to work on bullying? Are boys?? I promise u cyber bullying is a thing and you can be a male or female, bullying doesn‚Äôt have to be physical at all it can be mental and some would say mental is way worse. So for u to sit here an say anyone has a problem with bullying because they don‚Äôt like the ad is very ignorant thinking. The problem with the ad is that we as PPL!! Not just men but PPL NEED TO DO BETTER. And this idea that it‚Äôs just men is ridiculous. Can u imagine if tampax put out a ‚Äúshort film‚Äù about how women need to be better! No more false rape claims! I mean it‚Äôs crazy not all females do that but I promise if they roped u all together it would piss u off!

 Also watch the other videos they do on the ad. She listens, questions him (or tries to) and debates (when Peirs let's her talk). I think part of her ""not seeing his point of view"" lies in the fact that they have two different definitions of masculinity."
,546.0,0,2019-01-20T23:31:52Z,@Cleopatra Anthony well you may wanna word it better next time but i didnt doubt she listened more than the others but just cause i did more or less doesnt make a difference she was involved more while the other stayed more reserved iam not sayin she deserved it but no one does its something that happens and i find the irony in them making comments like that but you have to realise thats out of anger and emotions can get the better of people especially on a online format but i disagree with her hearing his side as she became combative but i digress so did he its a passionate topic however once he had made his side she should have been questionative on how the message could have been miscontrued as it is rather then let me interject heres why i like disregarding the way the message was displayed at least that is the vibe i get from her talking and i know he goes on rants and does the same i am not trying to support one or the other as i dont really watch either much and dislike both i just was seeing peoples takes on the ad
,547.0,0,2019-01-20T23:18:52Z,"@Cerberus 328 I wasn't blaming Peirs for others comments, just pointing out how there is misogynistic abuse in comments, which I found kind of ironic since that's the kind of behaviour the Gillett ad was referencing.  

Also if you watch their discussions on this ad you will see that Suzanne does the most listening out of the two. Peirs often goes on rants and the only way she can get a word in is to speak over him. 

It seems Suzanne heard his side and disagrees, the abuse she's getting is undeserved.  I also think a part of it is that she is playing devils advocate to represent both sides. I've seen her arguing ""for"" things she disagrees with many, many times."

,562.0,0,2019-01-20T19:44:19Z,nietzsche that is a very flawed rebuttal. There are plenty of men who agree/like/are ok with the commercial. Did you even think it through before you wrote it?
,563.0,0,2019-01-20T19:42:03Z,"Ian Stevenson well, I think you are thinking a bit small. I don‚Äôt mean this in an offensive way, I just mean that I think the ad‚Äôs goal wasn‚Äôt as simple as ‚Äúlet‚Äôs get the toxic men to listen to us and be better‚Äù. I think they knew exactly what response they were going to get (all of this backlash) and I think that they were actually counting on it. I don‚Äôt think that for a second did they think men who actually do the bad things portrayed in the commercial would sit across their little screen and go ‚Äúyou are right, Gillette! Thanks for making me a better person! I‚Äôll change right now!‚Äù. That wasn‚Äôt their goal! That is stupid because everyone knows it would never happen and that‚Äôs small minded anyway. They want us all, as a society, to hold men who do that shit accountable and expect better of them as well as raise our children that way. They aren‚Äôt preaching to certain men to change, they‚Äôre preaching to us as a society to change in that respect (by not accepting that kind of behavior, mentality, etc). Furthermore, the backlash is key in this because that‚Äôs the only way nowadays to get people to talk about you. No one has ever talked about freaking razors as much as they are talking about it now. I think they hit two birds w one stone. And I couldn‚Äôt disagree more when u said a man should have directed it. That to me is the same as saying that only black people should talk about the usage of the word nigger or only whoever has been assaulted can talk about sexual assault and so forth. I think everyone regardless of gender, race, etc can talk about and have an opinion on anything they want. The directly affected may have a better inside look at it in some instances but everyone has the right to chime in on anything. So I‚Äôm ok with a woman directing this just as much as I‚Äôd be ok with a man making a commercial about how scary feminism can get in certain instances.

To close this I‚Äôll say that I only have two issues w the ad. The fact that they said ‚Äúsome‚Äù at a time in the ad when they talk about how men are breaking those stereotypes. I think they should have said ‚Äúmany‚Äù. Another possible problem is that it **MAY** be favoring non white men. I can understand why they said ‚Äúsome‚Äù instead of ‚Äúmany‚Äù and why they would (possibly) be favoring non white men but just because I get it, it doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôll agree with the choice, or like it. The ad is still great tho and I stand with it."

Its kinda like when someone has small dick and you call em out on it...they usually get so upset like ""OMG my penis is massive ughhhh""....but someone who actually who actually has hige dick.

Gilette's message was: ""Be a decent human being."" That's it. It didn't say: ""men are shit"", but again, that's just my opinion. Lower are comments from dudes who call the co-host a slut who needs to be fucked, just because she has a different opinion. I didn't see you getting mad there for the blatant misogyny displayed there. So go whine to someone else. I don't hate men, like at all but I do find the fragile kind very hilarious."

Because when men used their product that felt they were grooming and doing the best as a man by taking care of themselves with gillete, ""the BEST"" a man can get!

You arent going to win men over by saying calling their masculinity ""toxic"". 

They seem to forget their place in the world. Gilletes job in marketing is to convince me, the consumer, to buy their product. Making me feel like an asshole doesnt accomplish that. At all. Who thought that was a good idea?? Utter imbeciles.

Now when people use it they're gonna think ""Okay better not let my toxic masculine traits show with my beard.

I said ""women have to WORK OUT a least twice as hard as men"". That means phisical excersise to build up and keep the phisical strength and stamina that is absolutely vital to fight fires and rescue people.

The message was clear (from 0:46 to 1:06): 'We believe in the best in men. Men should hold other men accountable. To say the right thing, to act he right way. Some already are'. By definition that 'some' implies that 'most' are still not. Not doing the right thing. You really think that that kind of bashing is not insultive? 
Let's see and ad from Gillete (they have a female customer base right?) with the roles reversed - first half of the video talking about how horrifiying women can be destroying lives of both men and women (literaly - including pressing people to suicide), and then say 'We believe the best in women. Women should hold other women accountable. To say the right thing. To act the right way. Some already are.' and show couple clips of black women policing white girls on their behavior. Would that be a good message? Than why is it that we always hear (day in and day out for the last several dozen years) how bad men are as a demographical group, but never do we hear anything even remotly on the same scale about women - we get only praising complements, pandering, protection, entitlements."

If every day you turned on the tv or went on the internet and had to listen to how being feminine is ‚Äòtoxic‚Äô, or how bad your gender is, you would eventually get fed up and frustrated too. 
The other main reason Piers and most men are bothered by this is it‚Äôs completely biased. You will never see any other group of people bashed like this in the media. Would you see a woman‚Äôs product being advertised by showing headlines of fake rape allegations, or women cheating, or anything else negative, telling the whole female gender they need to improve? No, because there‚Äôd be pandemonium 10x greater than this.
And besides this, the ad doesn‚Äôt make sense. It‚Äôs bad to approach a pretty lady now? Telling a girl to smile at a pool party? Since when was bullying only done by males?
As a dad of 2 girls, I hate this ad too, because when they‚Äôre older I want men to be able to approach them freely so they can get a date, which will never happen the way things are going, men will be too scared of offending them and being ostracized for it."

I clearly said as much in my last comment ('I never said you can't have an opinion') but you went on to deploy your asinine straw man tactic anyway. To what end?

Getting angry is not the same as a hissy fit and the problem is that, as things are now, the people that are most offended will most likely shape the future and if you don't start getting angry over this stupid emotional rhetoric just about now, you'll live in a world controlled by these ""hissy-fits"" children.

My point is that both sides are getting needlessly offended. And I never said you can't have an opinion, but when you start throwing hissy fits it shows that you're emotionally insecure, and such insecurity is weak and repulsive to me as a man, and it is precisely for that reason why I don't care about 'seeming' reasonable.

They want to make speech they don't like illegal and think of themselves as the most caring human beings with obviously the highest morals.
Not liking an ad because some rich corporation is talking down to you how your behaviour and speech is wrong has nothing to do with a ""snowflake"", it's called having an opinion and yes, you can't just make any video, advertisment and call the people that dislike it snowflakes or ""the same as on the left""

This unfortunately proves that men are NOT generally rational and stoic as a lot of people seem to believe, and a lot of men are prone to emotional outbursts over minuscule things. Men have inadvertently contributed to the success of this ad."
,724.0,0,2019-01-19T12:29:42Z,"Exactly! It's a bit ironic. The people that are outraged over this ad are often the same people that chastised feminists for complaining about sexualization of women in the media/games etc. 'It's just a game/ad , get over it!'. Now the same group of people is are throwing hissy fits and letting a 2 minute ad from a corporation control their emotions. Call me old fashioned, but I feel men should be more calm and calculated, and shouldn't let something as simple as a commercial fiddle with their emotions."
586.0,,3,2019-01-19T12:22:18Z,"I think the feminist movement does not say that all masculinity is toxic, just that some extreme aspects of masculinity is bad.
That said, I have a simple question: Are there any extreme aspects of femininity that are toxic? If so, is it studied in the academic circles? If not, then are the feminists saying that one gender (female) is inherently better than the other because there's no aspect of femininity that can be labeled as toxic even when taken to the extreme?"

Playfighting was vilified in this ad, BBQing was vilified for no reason.

,818.0,0,2019-01-21T14:41:34Z,"Why should I be ignoring the hate or provocation simply by thinking I'm some untoucheable alpha male and that's it ? The reason for people (mostly men) being outraged is because the people who came out with this bullshit ad are trying to make all men responsible for the acts of some toxic idiot men that are just a minority. All men should not apologise for the acts of some utter cunts as said in the video. The message behind the video may be noble, but the delivery is simply pathetic. I believe the ad should employ the term ""toxic masculity"" instead of ""Men"" or ""masculinity""', because the definition of the latter never included the terms ""harassment"" nor ""bullying""."
,819.0,0,2019-01-20T14:41:14Z,"Look if  you get so hurt by some commercial stating that ""bullying is bad"" or ""its always better to help someone"" or ""Men helping society is a good thing"" then maybe you're not as masculine as you think. Your masculinity definitely should be questioned. Ever since in High school i had a huge beard. I started working out when I was really young. After University my go to hobby is boxing. I do a lot handy work around the my gf house. My ex gf all considerd me ""Manly"". I dont need to prove to people that im a tough guy or im manly. They call me a pussy or a wimp ...cool. When someone says boxing is gay...or when my friends or my brother call me feminine...or they call me a girl. Im okay with. IT DOESNT HURT MY MASCULINITY. If it does was I masculine enough to begin with. Its kinda like when someone has small dick and you call em out on it...they usually get so upset like ""OMG my penis is massive ughhhh""....but someone who actually who actually has hige dick. Doesnt give a shit. If call him out hes not gonna care cuz he knows how big it. Are you serious...Like a stupid commercial got your panties in bunch wowowow."
690.0,,1,2019-01-18T19:29:25Z,"It's a fair point that no way could there be a female equivalent of this ad. But that's because of the sexist notion that women are too soft and delicate to be criticised when yes, there is such a thing as toxic femininity. 
Having said that, I do not understand why it suggests masculinity is bad, it's suggesting the good men have the courage and decency to step in and do the right moral thing, there is nothing masculine about cowardly complicity with wrongdoing, or being a man behaving badly in the first place."

,890.0,0,2019-01-18T10:19:06Z,I think she's had to since this show began. Piers as we all know is an extremely arrogant loud mouth who still think's he's on the Piers Morgan show and forgets that he isn't...and he has a co-host. So at the beginning she was talked down and shouted over and just ignored and the public gave him a lot of stick for it and told her to start speaking her part. She seems to be doing that now. Plus sometimes she just won't agree with him. She puts it across nicely as well unlike him with anything he disagrees with.

Sure switch brands if you feel you want but it's only marketing. For years Gillette and others have charged women more for their razors than the ones they sell aimed at men. Some smart women realised this and bought the male version to save money. All it revealed was that in general women are easier to market to than men and will pay more so Gillette took advantage. 

This advert doesn't mean Gillette hate men. It merely shows that with marketing huge companies will do and say anything if it improves sales."

You're correct, the right is under massive attack, through forms of demonization to remove free speech. Because of this, playing a card assumes there's no argument, but in actual fact, there is and it's clear as day. 
The media and SJW types speak of institutional racism, to which they are famously asked, ok, give examples of exactly where by the likes of Ben Shapiro, to only answer with a fluffy, in the aura answer. Contrary to this, the opposite is true to white males, as there's preferential employment given to ethnic minorities through positive discrimination. This is why when applying for a job roll digitally, it asks to input, religion, race and what gender you assume, as it's a must under the government equality laws to employ a demographic from all. Jobs should be given to the right people regardless of all that nonsense.

How do you expect a man to choose one of those jobs where his life will be at risk and the working conditions will be poor if he hasn‚Äôt been conditioned socially or biologically to do so. He does it because he has learnt or developed traits that are now described as toxic masculinity.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_HL0wiK4Zc"
966.0,,1,2019-01-17T16:31:07Z,"The ad is brilliant. 
So often nowadays, we are too quick to assume and expect the negative‚Äîand rightly so, because our culture and society is crumbling at the seams‚Äîbut in hastily judging, we sometimes miss these once-in-a-while gems.  Albeit worldly, this ad is right-on!!! 

Masculinity is NOT necessarily muscle mass.
Masculinity is NOT how many women you‚Äôve had.
Masculinity is NOT knowing how to sweet-talk a woman.
Masculinity is NOT being the coolest ‚Äúdude‚Äù on the block.
Masculinity is NOT how much violence you can drown yourself in.
Masculinity is NOT necessarily how cold-hearted and rough/tough you can be.

A real man IS simply strong.
A real man IS God-fearing, not a ladies‚Äô man.
A real man IS sincere, kind, and honest.
A real man IS humble, confident, and secure‚ÄîNOT a show-off.
A real man IS capable of *defense,* but strong enough to be meek.
A real man IS stable, but strong enough to be emotionally vulnerable‚ÄîNOT invincible.

Real masculinity treats femininity with dignity and respect‚Äînot because women are more worthy, strong, or deserving than men‚Äîbut because women are the weaker gender! The Bible says so, and science proves it. (Women are naturally more ‚Äúmotherly‚Äù and all that means, but men are naturally more ‚Äúfatherly‚Äù and all that means.) It‚Äôs all better when men are ‚Äúgiving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel...‚Äù (1 Peter 3:7)

Unlike psychology teaches, men and women are not robots driven by urges!!! That‚Äôs the furthest from the truth. We are mankind, and we have a soul and a spirit (in God‚Äôs image ~ see Genesis 1:26);  therefore, we ought to act like human beings who indeed have a mind‚Äînot like animals who indeed have basically one purpose (reproduction and all that means). 

Somewhere along the way in the last 50 years, masculinity became all about sexiness, and that way of thinking is NOT good, even according to the Bible and evidenced in society.  There used to be a whole debacle about ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù vs. ‚Äúbad boys,‚Äù remember? (Good guys are overall gentlemen; bad boys basically are flirty.) But newsflash: Marriage is not sexy! Marriage is a forevermore bond of hearts and lives (and on earth, bodies). Intimacy is blown WAY out of proportion nowadays and totally misconstrued and idolized, even under the guise of properly legal marriage.

Gillette is not shaming men for being attracted to women. Actually, for once, a company of the world (Gillette) is shaming jerks for being pervs, attacking the sin of lust without saying a word about it. Perhaps Gillette has its own agenda behind the ad, but they‚Äôre at least presenting something very biblical here, and conservatives ought to recognize this truth instead of brushing it aside because they feel somewhat convicted or mistakingly attacked. Just imagine for a minute if one of the jerks out there (shown in the ad) tampered with your daughter in any way... Would all be well? It‚Äôs just ‚Äúmasculinity,‚Äù right? No. See?

And since when did Christians start justifying boys‚Äô bad behavior as ‚Äúboyishness‚Äù?!  No, boyishness refers to adventure playtime and getting dirty, as they often justifiably prefer to do; rather, toxic masculinity refers to perverted losers who act like they‚Äôre better than other men for being more immoral and/or buff. 

*** I am NOT a feminist OR a misogynist: I‚Äôm just a saved, sinful female who appreciates the apparent attempt to support the comeback of chivalry and kindness."

To me your second point makes little sense to me.

,1086.0,0,2019-01-17T18:13:09Z,"James West - It‚Äôs simple. 

If the add was reversed and told women not to falsely accuse men of rape, thereby ruining their lives, not to take advantage of child support and no fault divorce courts, not to be cheating gold digging whores etc; The level of outrage and accusations of sexism/misogyny towards women in the media would be simply astronomical. 

That‚Äôs the first contention. 

Secondly; If it were white men stepping in to stop a black man hitting on a woman, the outcry of racist accusations from SJWs and leftist media sources alike would also be astronomical. 

Upon that simple analysis alone it‚Äôs abhorrently obvious a grossly vitriolic double standard exists in current ‚Äúprogressive‚Äù society - one which is directed straight at the Caucasian heterosexual man. ‚Äú It‚Äôs ok if we do it, but not if you the white male does it, for you are the problem ‚Äú 

If you still can not comprehend this factually objective narrative, then yes, you do have the mind of a woman, and most likely high estrogen-levels.

Lastly, it portrays two boys rough housing ( natural boyish behavior ) as wrong and harmful, this is conveying as piers said himself, the message that masculinity is dangerous. 
bare in mind a communism supporting feminist directed this advertisement. That should tell you all you need to know."

It‚Äôs not making any sort of comparison. You are the one making the comparison based on your own insecurities. You see something generally considered masculine such as this ad and you instantly compare it to see how close it is to a feminine equivalent. 

The ad is saying we as men aren‚Äôt the best we can be currently (and it‚Äôs not wrong). It then proceeds to give a variety of ways in which members of the male gender are failing. Some are raping. Some are fighting. Some are just ignorant to mental health. Some are doing or failing to do other things. From this we are meant to take away a lesson that applies to us... not assess how every little detail applies to our lives. It doesn‚Äôt matter what type of people each topic refers to... it ain‚Äôt just normal people that see ads. It‚Äôs targeted at all men and almost types of men will view it... not just the non-raping men and innocent little kids."
,1089.0,0,2019-01-17T15:48:19Z,"@James West you are still failing to think logically and are consumed by the emotion of assuming no woman would ever be wrong. On the contrary the advertising company in question has made several campaigns on the basis of feminism and communist ideals of equality. What basis does Gillette have as a brand with men as a primary target audience, to produce a politically motivated advert accusing men of being rapists? If Gillette is concerned about this they are free to fund any number of charities who are founded to care for victims of rape. Why do you fail to understand that it is a psychopath who is a rapist and therefore no amount of prior moral lambasting of men will prevent the psychopath from committing rape? No in fact the advert is not concerned with the victims of rape, but it is designed to reduce men in society by undermining their authority. On this basis social engineers have free control over the levers of social control."
,1090.0,0,2019-01-17T15:40:02Z,"J [Max Ignoramus] J it‚Äôs not saying all men are rapists though.

If you‚Äôre watching it thinking they‚Äôre actively warning you to apply the ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be a rapist‚Äù part to your own life then honestly I‚Äôm starting think that‚Äôs just a guilty conscience on your part.

The fact that you fail to understand the difference between a man and a psychopath reveals the nature of your mind; That you see no problem with an advert accusing men of being rapists on the basis of gender alone, because you fail to think logically and have been consumed by the woman's mind, who thinks on the basis of her emotion, and is easily caught up in social trends, despite the detriment to society as a whole.

,1098.0,0,2019-01-17T14:36:21Z,James West.. I would agree with you James if this advert was an isolated case but it isn't. it is the latest in a long list of actions that have the sole intention of undermining and weakening the male gender. in my opinion it is an attempt to break down the dominance of men in top employment. women have not been as successful as they thought they would be with equality and so are now trying to destroy the competition by feminizing men.

,1131.0,0,2019-01-17T13:19:20Z,@Morgan Yu I agree that men seem to be getting put in a negative light in the media quite often and it needs to be explained that the majority of men don‚Äôt behave in this way and these are worst case scenarios. But Piers seemingly fails to see that this is not a threat to his masculinity or any other man. The advert is addressing violence and morals of *some men* not our ‚Äúentire gender‚Äù not everything has to be spelt out for you. You can clearly see that this advert doesn‚Äôt apply to you specifically. Obviously Gillette‚Äôs target is a male audience so they will focus on problems usually seen in men. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs enough evidence to suggest that woman typically do the same things but correct me if I‚Äôm wrong. Everyone in this comment section seems to be getting offended but if it doesn‚Äôt apply to their *actions* (not their gender) then why should they be?

You idiot. Look at the context set by the old Gillette commercial. A groom hugging his father. A father holding his naked baby. Boys competing at sports. A father teaching his son how to shave. 

""The best a man can get."" Hey men, if you need to shave, we think our razor is the best you can get.

Now Gillette is telling men to *be better!* Showing the worst examples of individuals and painting their bad behaviour onto the gender. Asking men to police the behaviour of other men - because they apparently have a responsibility to do that, because they were born with the same arbitrary characteristics... they share a gender.

Do women have to police the behaviour of other women? Do people of certain races have to police the behaviour of people of the same race?

The new advert is utter tripe. Telling an entire gender to ""be better"" starts with the assumption that there is something that needs addressing with the people of that gender (hundreds of millions of INDIVIDUALS in Western countries lumped into an arbitrary group and judged on that.) And as Piers noted, the things Gillette seemingly suggests need to be addressed, are the things that they have focused on to sell their razors in the past.

Men competing. Striving for status and success etc. The old advert shown here is infinitely better than the newest advert. Because it is not mired in and utilising the absurd concepts of intersectionality, postmodernism, and third-wave feminist terms like ""toxic masculinity""."

Masculinity isn't toxic in itself. Be wary of people who think this way. I respect your opinion and hope i can at least change your mind because there is a war on masculinity and this advert is just one example.

However you'll need to make sure that's not P&G - otherwise it will end up in their pocket, too.
Problem is that global corporation have got too big and now start playing God while the state turned into church ...

Regarding ""masculinity"": the reason for this is that women increasingly put up masculinity make-up and expect to be taken seriously.
Masculinity is not something a man is because some ad tells one to be!
Man does not equal man: a man needs to ""afford"" to be masculine in order to be taken seriously as masculine, masculinity isn't something I ""learn"" to be, it's real, it's individual and circumstantial ...
But now women need a right to ""win"" (whatever they think there is to win) and because reality doesn't work this way they want to educate men to let them win. The point here is that a man does not need to do anything in order for a women to be afraid of him, just because he could!!!

However, what bothers me is not women.
It's the men supporting this!

Let me give you an example: I am not a sexual harasser, assaulter or rapist, I do not need to be educated, neither do I need to apologize to anyone. Would I be one of those, then I'd publicly declare my willingness to improve myself, constantly apologize for all men suggesting that all men were assholes like me and of course turn a feminist fighting for equality and social justice.
And I'll get promoted.

It's those men which will raise with feminism: psychopaths and bitches driven by mediocrity, inferiority, greed and envy ... and at best opportunism.
Like always in socialism!

Most women will end up sucking leader-dick under feminism, after the ""masculine"" men have been destroyed by their naivety and stupidity."

Western women have embraced their government appointed 'female privilege' and willingly used it for their own benefit by participating in divorce rape, false domestic violence accusations, allowing separated fathers limited access to their children and the financial enslavement to the female via draconian child support payments. Women have embraced all these things that destroy western society and lowered birth rates.
So please, don't try to lecture men about not being offended, western men are under direct attack by the media, their own governments and their own women, so don't play innocent and start pointing ur finger at men for standing up for themselves against the false portrayals that most of u women have swallowed hook line and sinker, and now have the nerve to liken wolf whistling to rape and to think ur all victims of 'toxic masculinity'.
Women have become tedious creatures that should be avoided for the most part, and that'd a sad thing to have to say.

Of course Gillette are hedging their bets, they know exactly what they doing. It‚Äôs simple, the progressive left put us in groups, based on colour, gender, sexual preference and so on, then rank or give status to groups according to their level of oppression, never once showing any interest in character and merit of each individual. Some groups, deemed not to be oppressed are fair game and some are hands off, just ask Kevin Hart. The irony is that irrespective of how anybody feels about this advert, everyone has been grouped and the progressives don‚Äôt actually care what you think. And it‚Äôs not just the male targeted in this ad, watch carefully in the ad and you‚Äôll see multiple levels of intersectionality at play, all very deliberate.

Their stock rose and their profits increased despite millions of consumers vowing they would boycott Nike products. It is just a marketing strategy that is being copied by Gillette. The more you talk about it, the more exposure and money they make. Piers is not stupid. He must know what he is doing and I wonder if he is not part of the whole publicity strategy, because some of what he is saying is just incorrect - hence the disbelief written all over the co-presenter's face. Do yourselves a favour, and watch the ad from beginning to end and then tell me: Does it portray ALL men as toxic? Does it say that Masculinity is toxic? Or does it simply show some inappropriate behaviours (bullying, sexual harassment...) performed by some (not all) men and encourage us to correct them? Surely Piers sees this, but he is deliberately ignoring what he seas and coming out with clearly false statements to stoke up the flames of dissent and, ironically,  promote the Gillette brand. It is just marketing, nothing more, nothing less.
So to those commentators who said that this is the first time they agree with anything he has ever said, you are being fooled."

the fact that they did not explicitly say all masculinity, does not make this even less sus either the black dudes know how to sell products to people (take that in any context you will) or they have an agenda ON TOP of the fact they need to sell shit, tldr Gillette did this for sales, they just shoved politics into it to sell more of the product simple as that weather or not the drive was genuine (i doubt it) or forced (almost guaranteed) is debatable i mean they had one ""liberal"" type on the bored of execs (i don't know how many people are on the bored of execs exactly if i could get a number i would much appreciate it), therefore  there one can easily deduce why the advert came about, the following is my hypothesize one of three conclusions are likely, the ""Liberal"" type made a good impression (probably true), they did it to shut him up (not as likely but still up there) or he just forced it down there thoughts  as a good idea (which it is, the amount of attention they got is unprecedented even if it is negative)"

Why is it that it is those that are most likely to have sexist views that feel offended by the commercial? If it is truly discriminatory, should it not be those that usually defend such values that should be speaking? What is so emotional about the topic and the add? In what way does it not value the man I want to be?"
,1265.0,0,2019-01-17T09:57:53Z,"Well men have mothers so for starters who is raising these villains of society? We know that in single parent households (predominantly single mother) the drop out rate and incarceration rate for kids is significantly higher. The ad is either propaganda or it relays truth. To your argument, because those who speak on discrimination are not raising a red flag here, we see that their fight is not against discrimination on the whole but rather a fight for a specific agenda. 
Men are more likely to be sexually assaulted if you include prison statistics, men are more likely to be incarcerated overall, men are more likely to die on the job, men are more likely to die in war, men are more likely to be janitors, work in coal mines, build bridges, etc. Shouldn't we have more female janitors and an equal amount of female garbage women as well? Or is it okay for those jobs to be dominated by men? What kind of message do you want to send to young men?  
You bring up a good question: ""In what way does it not value the man I want to be?"". The answer is outlook and context. The ad exists within a context of social justice and its message is clear. Men are toxic. If you want to be a man who says his son striving for success is an expression of toxic masculinity, if you call that son getting a merit based promotion over a woman an expression of the patriarchy and if his looking at a colleague in the eyes at the workplace for more than 5 seconds is determined as sexual misconduct (I forget the company that implemented this), then the outlook of the ad matches with your own. Baby steps become bigger leaps, I think people are reacting to the overall trend and societies overall current disdain of young men."

and of the 7 men showing good behavior only 2 were white, call it as you will but i personally think it is suspicious, (also the ad made no sense it basicaly said dont do that shit, well i have some news you saying it ain't going to do anything, and you telling us men to become pussies is not going to help either, i had two friends who got picked on as kids one manned up the other one stayed a pussy, the one who is a pussy is broke single and homeless, the one who manned up is doing good for him self, yeah making men pussies is a good idea Gillette it sure is a good idea"

You can't be powerful (man can abuse woman in workplace), 
can' be funny (you might hurt someone), 
can't take care of your wife (she's a woman, she can do it for yourself)
can't compete with others, can't be the best (toxic musculinity)

I think you may be missing the point. This ad is just a reflection of the greater issue at hand and people, not just men are seeing the pattern and are sick and tired of it. It‚Äôs called intersectionality, critical theory, dreamt up by left progressive ‚Äúintellectuals‚Äù and pushed by main stream media. Of course Gillette are hedging their bets, they know exactly what they doing. It‚Äôs simple, the progressive left put us in groups, based on colour, gender, sexual preference and so on, then rank or give status to groups according to their level of oppression, never once showing any interest in character and merit of each individual. Some groups, deemed not to be oppressed are fair game and some are hands off, just ask Kevin Hart. The irony is that irrespective of how you feel about this advert, you yourself are in a group and the progressives don‚Äôt actually care what you think. And it‚Äôs not just the male targeted in this ad, watch carefully in the ad and you‚Äôll see multiple levels of intersectionality at play, all very deliberate. I would hate to see an ad highlighting female ‚Äútoxic‚Äù behaviour purely out of respect for all the strong woman in my life, non of who claim victimhood and oppression to anything. I and my family stand for the only minority that matters, the individual, which is why Gillette will never be found in my home again, simple."

In the same principle it would be like marketing tampons and saying to women, ""don't make false rape claims, don't raise your children poorly, don't fake maternity leave, don't bitch to other women, don't force other women to look a certain way by social media""....

Well lets not argue actually I feel like we need to understand each others point. Look women all ready have bad enough...yup yup you are right so do men...men have it very tough but yall literally talk bout it all the time.
For example: A woman breaths....and everyone starts yelling omg you hate men. We men deserve better blah blah

Some people get angry when a woman uses a guy for his money. I do to. Its not right lol....but wont get angry when a guy rapes a girl and admits to it. When there is hotel footage of the assault taking place. 

Theres a huge difference between you boys(technically little girls because of how emotional you get over a fucking commercial) and Men 

The add just states that men behave badly sometimes and we should teach them better. Omg the entire world goes crazy. Why don't you guys go crazy when a women is forced marry someone they don't like in India at a very young age(13,14). Why don't you boycott companies that literally have child slaves.

Your masculinity definitely should be questioned. Ever since in High school i had a huge beard. I started working out when I was really young. After University my go to hobby is boxing. I do a lot handy work around the my gf house. My ex gf all considerd me ""Manly"". I dont need to prove to people that im a tough guy or im manly. They call me a pussy or a wimp ...cool. When someone says boxing is gay...or when my friends or my brother call me feminine...or they call me a girl. Im okay with. IT DOESNT HURT MY MASCULINITY. If it does was I masculine enough to begin with. Its kinda like when someone has small dick and you call em out on it...they usually get so upset like ""OMG my penis is massive ughhhh""....but someone who actually who actually has hige dick. Doesnt give a shit. If call him out hes not gonna care cuz he knows how big it. Are yours serious...Like a stupid commercial got your panties in bunch wowowow.

1243.0,,2,2019-01-16T23:08:11Z,"I disagree with Morgan. To me the Gillett advert are showing what toxic masculinity looks like. Toxic masculinity is being a bystander to things happening to others and not stepping up or intervening where they can, belittling a womens view (the guy in the office putting his hand on the woman) and touching a woman inappropriately and thinking it's funny. Not all men are like this and I don't think the advert is saying that all men are either. They are trying to promote what a good man is or should be doing which is intervening when necessary. 

My aunty's friend said she saw two men move to another carriage so they wouldn't have to sit close to a woman being kicked repeatedly by a random stranger. It was two women who had to chase him off. Where the two men should have stepped in and told the man to leave her alone, they removed themselves from the situation. They turned away and left someone in need of help.

There are some men out there, SOME, NOT ALL who need to be reminded of that. Though l have to say if thats what Gillette wanted to promote it could have been done differently by some other business or corporation. Gillette should stick to selling razors and show support of this topic, if they feel strongly about it, in other ways."
,1344.0,0,2019-01-17T23:10:03Z,"@Ratbacon that first line, nice retort (being genuine not sarcastic) I have to say it made me laugh, even though it was a dig at me it did make me smile. 

While I know there is nothing I can say for you to hear me when I say, I do not agree with how Gillette did the advert I'm gonna respond to the points you made and then let this go. 

I used the word toxic masculinity because that's what Morgan used in his argument to make his points. Not saying that he came up with it, but I used what he said to explain what I felt the advert was showing as toxic masculinity. I concur that yes some women can be just as toxic in how they behave like some men.  

The belittling a women's view point was made because thats what was shown in the advert. It was a woman sitting in the chair not a man. If there was a man sitting there it would be wrong too. A boss shouldn't belittle his employees period, no matter their gender. 

As for the carriage story I wanted the men to have stepped up because there's strength in numbers and people should not just sit by and watch injustice. My Aunty's friend didn't think going by herself would be enough to diffuse the situation, and she said she was scared. Don't know if the women who approached the attacker knew each other or if they got up and went to the attacker at the same time.  All I know is he left once they approached him. I made the point in a previous message that what I think Gillette was trying to address in their ad was ""A good man intervenes when necessary and is not a bystander"", a reason why I didn't agree with how they did the advert, because that applies to any and everyone. Case and point from my Aunts carriage story with what the women did, they intervened. It should be good people intervene when necessary not just 'good men'. My point in referencing the men was that they didn't intervene. 

Anyway I have said my last words on the matter, lol. Honestly as a  woman if they did this for women, depicting what makes a 'good woman' I'd be like well they got their wires crossed and make the decision like most comments I've read, not to support them by buying their products.  

It's night by me so good night and thank you for explaining your points on the advert."
,1345.0,0,2019-01-17T18:43:50Z,"@B3llaBambin4 On hindsight, bigot was entirely the wrong word so I apologise. I meant sexist.

Toxic masculinity - this statement is clearly sexist as there is no female equivalent but there is definitely toxic female behaviour.

Belittling a womans view - this is its entirely a non-gendered issue. You can replace the woman with a man and it would be exactly the same. This isn't sexist behaviour, its shitty, patronising behaviour and women do it as much as men. The fact you and Gillette view it in a gendered way is why you are sexist.

The carriage story - you are implying the men should have stepped up because patriarchy or something. Sure they were cowards but again the fact you think they should have done something solely because they were men is ..... sexist. They obviously don't feel obligated to behave in masculine ways. I can't imagine why, it's not like society is currently demeaning anyone for that kind of thinking."
,1346.0,0,2019-01-17T17:59:00Z,"@Ratbacon the fact that you think I'm a bigot becasue I have a different opinion to yours or ""most of the populuation"" to quote you is quite small minded. There will alwyas be people who disagree with each other from time to time. Theres nothing wrong with that. I'm not really surprised that some people don't like it, never said I did, and explaining my opinion of what I got from the advert is not being preachy either.  

I said before its one of those topics that really no matter who talks about it there will always be negative backlash. It's sensitive, it's telling people what to do or how to live and people are not going to like that.  

I have watched the advert and perceived it in one way even went on to say that I don't really agree with how the company have done it. The fact that we have differing opinions is fine, so long as we're not trying to impose our views on each other. If there is something that you think I have missed about the message in the advert from a man's perspective then share it, in a non demeaning manner. One of the ways of getting others to hear your point and even reconsidering their stance on something, is through your approach. With that said I hope you have a nice day."

The fact there is even a phrase ""toxic masculinity"" is also the problem. You're just a bigot and you cannot even see it, then get all surprised and preachy when most of the population, of both genders, don't like it."

As I stated before, I saw what the advert was trying to do though it could have been done differently. And even saying that I don't think there is anyway a topic like that could be put out in the media without some form of negative backlash."

,1404.0,0,2019-01-17T10:13:57Z,"Honestly, I agree with you, and it was a low insult that I should have refrained from. I did not mean to judge all rightists subject as bad or evil. There have been lots of good representatives from the right, Lincoln and Roosevelt are perhaps the presidents I respect the most. 
I also agree that it was a big part of why Trump was elected, and that the left severely failed to adress concerns that are important to a lot of people. I think their strategy and concerns were a major fail. I do not think that all leftist standpoints are good. 
But I really believe that in the last few years the right has leaned towards ideas and values that are truly hurtful for America and for other countries. The acceptance of Trump's lies, that he is not called out by more than a few rebublicans, and that republicans that are leaving offices in states are trying to strip the office they are leaving of power so that the incoming democrats will be without any real power, is damaging for democracy. Also how Trump closes down the government to push through the wall, essentially bypassing Congress. You see the same with the denial of climate change, and when there are suggestions about stuff that is good, like free healthcare, and college tuition, and green jobs, the representatives on FoxNews etc deliberately lie about it in order to confuse their watchers. I think that is more dangerous than the classical republican values of free markets, strong military, small government, second amendment etc. 
I realise this strides quite a bit from the subject in the video though."

That's the point where I lose interest in continuing the conversation and it's the biggest problem with leftists. People on the right accept that people on the left just happen to have different opinions whereas people on the left are intolerant of anybody who disagrees with them on anything. It's never ""I guess we just see things differently"". It's always ""If you don't agree with everything I say, you're racist/sexist/homophobic/etc.""
For people who preach a lot about tolerance, you're not very tolerant of different opinions. Hopefully you grow out of it one day and realise how poisonous that attitude is and is frankly a big part of the reason why Trump was elected."
,1406.0,0,2019-01-17T07:22:12Z,"Dismissing his article because he is not a doctor is really missing the mark, since toxic masculinity is not a medical subject, but a sociological and perhaps psychological. I don't know where you researched him, but it seems that you are part of the manosphere, so forgive me but reading extremely toxic articles from that place is not research. It is looking for answers that you want, not what is actually true and good. 
If you believe in ""the red pill"", read this subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/exredpill/
He discusses toxic femininity here: https://www.doctornerdlove.com/episode-99-lets-talk-about-toxic-femininity/
I will grant you that he does not consider it as much of a problem than toxic masculinity, but do you know why? Because there is no societal consensus excusing bad female behaviour like false allegations with ""girls will be girls"". That is the main issue he is addressing. 
I do not think he has said what side of the political spectre he supports, but given that toxic masculinity is embraced on the right, I think you are right that he is on the left. You know, the good side. 
Are you really sure that all of the boys in Zimbabwe came out more than fine? What about the gays? Or those that did not really fit the harsh masculinity you imply was prevalent? Are you sure some did not suffer? Then you have a much more detailed insight into your peers' life than I do with mine."

Researching him shows that he's a hardcore leftist who's so pro-feminist that when asked to discuss toxic femininity multiple times (since he focuses all his energy on criticising men and ""toxic masculinity"") he trivialises it and dismisses and laughs it off.
So if you want me to pay any attention to an article, give me one written by an objective person with credentials, not one who you can predict what he's going to say based on his politics.
Not to mention that he couldn't be any more obviously a beta male so of course he has those opinions. I grew up at a boarding school in Zimbabwe where things are 1000 times tougher for boys than in the western world and we all came out more than fine. Boys need to be boys. It's part of growing up. Then you have these radical feminists who won't even allow the boys scouts to do their thing. They already have girls scouts but that's not enough. They feel the need to infiltrate the boys and not allow them to have their own space where they can learn to be young men without the distraction of girls being there."

I do think that false allegations is very bad, but I also think it is a far less common problem than the  catcalling, objectification and excusing of male behaviour (boys will be boys) that we see in this video. 

If you really do care about men, you should read up about toxic masculinity and how it is hurting everybody, men most of all.

If there was a commercial of women making false allegation claims for the entire commercial and then there were one or two women telling the women not to do that, do you think people like you would still hold the position of ""the commercial shows that there are some women who don't do those things"" or do you think there would be incessant outrage from women/feminists? The answer is obvious.

Probably because the fraction of muslims doing those things is very small, and they probably do not use Gillette razorblades B-) Gillette is targetting males in general which are their main consumerist group, and also they are pointing out stuff that is quite common.

My opinion is that this is not a general critique of men, but an attempt at inspiring to be better. Do you not agree that there are som critical aspects of what is considered masculine behaviour, and that it is possible to change while still being true men? Just watch in the comments below how much hatred and use of slurs directed at someones masculinity, like feminist, mangina, snowflake etc. This is the toxic masculinity. This is what is hurting men, like in the example above of suicides - that there are unwritten rules about how male behave and that bad behaviour is excused. This can, and should be changed. 

Don't take the ad to personal. If you do not do any of the misogynistic stuff that is pointed out, then good for you! But some do. And they need to be called out. If you look closely you will see that all the people in the add that calls out the bad behaviour, are men. Men are both the bullies, heroes and victims in this add - and that includes every color."

It is quite astonishing to see how they both so very misinterprets this ad. They should read more about what they are complaining about.

If this advert is shown in Britain then Gillette (P&G) will quite clearly be breaking the law.

""[Advertisements] must not include gender stereotypes that are likely to cause harm, or serious or widespread offence."" 
www.asa.org.uk/news/harmful-gender-stereotypes-in-ads-to-be-banned.html.

Men should file complaints with the Advertising Standards Agency (ASA).¬† If the ASA do not ban Gillette's misandric #MeToo ad then men should litigate against the ASA and Gillette through a judicial review in the courts.¬† Men should publicise the case as high as they can to cause maximum damage to Gillette."

Soy boys (sexual perverts) and minorities whom are consistently in Democrat cities are jailed for sexual abuse and other top sexual predators like creeps like Weinstein and Roman Polanski  types and other Hollywood and political left persons protected from prosecution for rape and other sexual crimes and abuses and are praised by the leftists like Meryl Streep, who is begging them for a job with their praise for the sexual predators creeps. 

If they did an ad about Hollywood, Media, social Media management, soy boys and Democrat Politicians (like Bill Clinton and Weiner) about stopping their sexual abuse of women, would hit far closer home of the place called: Truth.

1325.0,,6,2019-01-16T17:14:11Z,"Unfortunately, like so much bigotry, once an identity group has the moral high ground, they get away with racism, sexism and any sort of discrimination.  So Jews can be racist, same with black people, same with Muslims and so on.  In the same way women are these days extremely sexist.

The simple truth is that stereotyping an identity group negatively, based on a minority (or even a majority) in that identity group is evil.  It really doesn't matter if you feel it is true, of if they are a majority in the population, or if they are in power, it is still sexism or racism. We all don't believe we are evil, I'm sure even Hitler didn't think he was evil, but it is completely delusional for a woman to think that stereotyping all men with toxic masculinity isn't sexist, as if somehow men can avoid being masculine.  The same is true of ""White Privilege"" being used to label all white people with moral inferiority.

I think that this kind of extreme stereotyping is just as evil as white supremacy or misogyny, the extremes on the other side, and I can't understand how some normally intelligent women, and individuals in minorities can make themselves look so ugly and evil, _in exactly the way_ that they themselves hate extremists on the other side of gender or racial politics, by stereotyping.

Being evil and ugly the other way, does not compensate or somehow even out.  You are still evil and ugly."

1331.0,,3,2019-01-16T16:25:57Z,"Apart from the ridiculously high prices, their cartridges have 4 blades too many anyway. You only need to use one blade for a good shave. I use both double edged and straight (cut throat) razors and once you get used to them, they give a close comfortable shave with little or no risk of ingrown hairs. When you use a five bladed razor, after the first blade does its work, you are done with that hair. When a second blade comes along right after the first, it cuts too closely and the remainder of the hair is at risk of growing inward. Weepers, those little cuts that need little bits of tissue etc. to stop the blood are another thing of the past with one properly used razor blade. Japanese Feather double edged blades are sharper so I never used their stuff anyway. Nor do I use the gel or foam goop. A good shaving soap like wool fat shaving soap is better for the skin. Manly skills like proper shaving techniques are diminishing because of the evil people who try to feminise the male population. It‚Äôs time to teach yourselves and your sons how to shave like men instead of simpering wimps!
It‚Äôs time to sort out all misandrists. Muller light is another misandrous company that should be boycotted. I‚Äôd be happy if, on the news, I heard that whoever is behind this misandry-fest, went bust and ended up so low, that even food banks refused them."

How is this atrocious campaign any different? Does bigotry not count if the main target is white men?
Do women not abuse their children, harass and bully other females to the point of suicide(cyber bullying) make false rape allegations, refuse their former husbands access to their own children, sexually abuse the young schoolboys they teach?

The huge implication there being that only some men are good role models but some is not enough, implying most men are not good role models and must change their bad ways. To be chastised for no reason is both offensive and patronising. Had it been the other way round saying only some men to change their ways they could have slipped through without offending too many people. The advert was both sexist and partially racist with the racial undertone that only white men are making the mistakes. Please look at the ad again clearly and you will see. This is the one time I agree with Piers for the most of it. I feel the core of the message as you put it standing up to harrasment etc was alright but the delivery was just disgusting. Again the claimed the majority of men are toxic, and only some are not. The unnecessary condemnation is appalling.  Also that scene where in the boardroom where the woman is made to be the victim, why was that included? So unneccesary. They were just pushing an agenda. Most men nowadays are not like that. Society needs to stop this man shaming. 
It negates from the purpose of their campaign anyway which is to sell razors primarily to men. Also when the black guy stops his white friend from talking to the girl, why? There was no hooting or hollering, he was going to try and have a pleasant convo, she couldve become his future wife. That's how I met my wife and we are a happy loving family.

Since those things have been taken away, these men are left with a gap, a hole in their development, a hole because their masculinity was never accepted, let alone nurtured.

The topic of this comment feed is the advert in question. Yes, men suffer. But ironically it's the same toxic masculinity (Which by the way is seperate from masculinity itself) that makes men have to stay quiet about feelings, or act like nothing affects them, when a lot of male suicides happen with no warning signs at all. You're attitude to life is that everyone is so offended by everything. I literally am talking to you and many others who are offended by shit like adverts and food items. I get offended by the fact my livelihood is diminished because I wasn't born a female. I got hurt by the fact I was violently bullied in school. But when I see a new food item including vegetarians onto their menus? I say that's progress in life. When I see an advert challenging perverts and men who do nothing but diminish the existence of women, like yourself, I praise it and say it spreads the right message.

We're not saying all men are bad, but I'm also not diminishing the existence of men in history.

May I remind you it was women who had to stay home during the two world wars and built all the weaponry. It was a gay man who invented what became the computer then was imprisoned for being homosexual. Everyone is equal, and deserves to be shown the same amounts of respect, something you lack for anyone who isn't born with a penis and stays that way.

,1507.0,0,2019-01-16T13:51:02Z,"@Lucy Michela On a final note.

43% of boys are raised by single mothers and 78% of teachers are female. This means that roughly half of boys are raised with 100% female influence at home and roughly 80% at school, this means that nearly 100% of their social experiences in childhood are derived from feminine influence.

I wasn't aware that women made perfect role models for masculinity and face the issues that men and boys face throughout their lives, their understanding of men must be incomprehensible compared to that of the tiny understanding that males have of their own nature, but I digress.

It seems to me that the problem with boys today isn't ""toxic"" masculinity, but a lack of masculinity altogether.

You're hella lucky that we didn't have today's incubation technology during the time of the cavemen.

How about you grow up and learn what a man is? The world we have today, where victimhood is positively thriving, wouldn't exist were it not for the traditional masculinity that shaped it.

Also, news flash numbskull, men are just as sexualized as women, difference is, they don't have a bunch of fragile minded miscreant females screaming objectification at the top of their lungs.

Also, the men aren't forcing these women to agree to take large sums of money to show a bit of boob, which your ilk claims are NOT sex objects, go fuck yourself in your obtusely shaped vagina.

I don't give a fuck what a human being is, why should I listen to that as a piece of advice, when humans as a collective do nothing but harm to each other and the world on a daily basis, whilst proclaiming a false morality built upon a concept they called humanity, which they themselves don't even live by. You seem to live in a mental fantasy world where no human ever gets involved in conflict and those that do are exclusively men and need putting down, just a stone's throw away from saying all men are born that way.

I say we bring back the 80's, nobody had a problem with masculinity back then, bar a near microscopic minority of rampant lesbians, though, women were largely not working and the traditional family values were in full implementation.

When there's an issue and a problem within a certain group, you have to be careful in how you can bring about that change, especially when you're an outsider (in this case the Gillette advert was produced by a feminist woman) . There's nothing wrong with creating an advert against sexual harassment and I don't think many people who didn't like the Gillette advert are against it too. Imo, Gillette got it wrong and produced an advert that looked too much like an attack and one that looked like a dog-whistle to a lot of left-wing, woke progressives. This article is good at explaining a reason why this is causing such a backlash: https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/12/weak-men-are-superweapons/"

,1530.0,0,2019-01-16T12:08:43Z,Masculinity is toxic until you are trapped in a burning house or raging river. And if there is such a thing as toxic masculinity then toxic femininity must be the label for bad female behavior. Yet I have never once heard this term. Why?
,1531.0,0,2019-01-16T10:10:43Z,it s about generalizing a group and blaming the colective for the tiny minority off offenders in it.

,1532.0,0,2019-01-16T09:44:32Z,"I think the outrage caused by the advert is due to the fact that an advert, which was meant to promote their shaving products, is talking about rape. I don't see why people are defending it. describing Piers using the phrase toxic masculinity is bigoted. It is all part of this agenda to break down social cohesion and divide groups of people wherever possible. This is just like what the Russians did in the 60's to 80's."

Then suddenly my daughter burst into the bathroom holding her phone. As I began to mansplain to her why she isn't smart enough to know my shaving time is my time she showed me the new Gillette ad.

Guys, talk about your damn feelings, and apathy isn't cool or brave. No wonder they always get shocked at people taking offense--like the men screaming about native american mascot naming, in the racist way--they don't know what feelings are, much less feeling offended. 

This generally stems from the fear of anything hinting at femininity as they are trying so hard to be perceived as men, and again, not people.

EX:

""Ill give you a reason to cry"" (emotions are for women (no I don't actually believe this--they do))

""p*ssy"" (disparaging the feminine)

""F*g"" (the incorrect assumption of a stereotype gay man being effeminate thereby bad)

""Walk it off, you'll be fine, don't take time to feel hurt"" (said any coach ever in men's sports, because feelings are for women's sports right???)

""Soy boy"" (incorrect fallacious reasoning about soy being like estrogen--feminizing men--, when phytoestrogens are nothing like this, in any scientific way aside from physical structure, at some level)

""Beta cu*k"" (Because some guy seemed less a man, or made an emotional reply, or stuck up for LGBT individuals online--as females are beta, to the male alpha--which by the way isn't a thing even in nature, Adam Ruins everything covered this topic)

AND ON AND ON AND ON

1537.0,,7,2019-01-15T20:37:10Z,Piers is completely right. The woman to his side is a complete imbecile. Gillette are a DISGRACE.
,1635.0,0,2019-01-16T08:11:43Z,@audience yep. Challenging her is an act of toxic masculinity of course.
,1636.0,0,2019-01-15T23:01:14Z,"Her demeanour is a common one, no introspection, unaware of her own bias because she's used to expressing casually misandrist views without being challenged."

,1639.0,0,2019-01-15T20:43:34Z,And how about woman falsly accusing man of sexual harrasment or rape? Lying so they can gett possesion of kuds after divorce? And dont forget that woman are great at bullying also.
,1640.0,0,2019-01-15T20:35:24Z,It‚Äôs because you‚Äôre not a man. You‚Äôre not wrong in joy understanding. It‚Äôs not your fault. There‚Äôs no blame to give you. But I‚Äôll be held accountable for fuck all.
,1641.0,0,2019-01-15T20:20:02Z,"lucie, I guess those poor men who drowned on the Titanic were held responsible for their actions when they ""allowed women and children first"" into the lifeboats."
,1642.0,0,2019-01-15T20:15:12Z,"How can you justify suppressing the natural instincts of half of the entire human species? 'Masculinity' is being a man. You can't redefine it to make it safe and 'non-toxic'. I can't honestly believe that people consider femininity to be so far superior to masculinity that men as a subset of the entire population need to change the way they act and think. Literally questioning every natural urge. Imagine how hard it is for young boys. Boys fight on instinct, it's completely natural and beneficial in the long term for both parties. 

One thing the Gillette advert seems to forget is that girls are not angels. Girls fight and bully and sexually harass. It's not exclusive to the male gender. This logic should stop this 'toxic masculinity' argument altogether"
,1643.0,0,2019-01-15T20:10:25Z,Because your a women. So clearly you don't understand how this is harmful
,1644.0,0,2019-01-15T20:09:03Z,lucie ilunga the calling of masculinity being toxic? Fuck that. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with being masculine. Just like there‚Äôs nothing wrong with being feminine.
