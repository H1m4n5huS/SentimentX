There also a folded black satanic robe. And in the same ad, there‚Äôs balenciaga tape. Except on it balenciaga is spelt ‚Äúbaal-enciaga‚Äù with the part ‚ÄúBaal‚Äù facing the camera. And ofc Baal is one of the idols they worshipped in biblical times and was known for child sacrifice. Similar to the child sacrifice we see in todays culture with this over sexualization, abortion, etc. On top of that, similarly how you translated ‚Äúba len ci aga‚Äù into Latin and it says ‚Äúdo what you want‚Äù (a known satanic phrase) if you type ‚ÄúBaal enci aga‚Äù it translates to Baal is king. They‚Äôre literally not even hiding it anymore because of how normalized it‚Äôs become  \n",
