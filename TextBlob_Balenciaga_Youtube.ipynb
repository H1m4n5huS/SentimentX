And ofc Baal is one of the idols they worshipped in biblical times and was known for child sacrifice. Similar to the child sacrifice we see in todays culture with this over sexualization, abortion, etc. On top of that, similarly how you translated â€œba len ci agaâ€ into Latin and it says â€œdo what you wantâ€ (a known satanic phrase) if you type â€œBaal enci agaâ€ it translates to Baal is king.

There also a folded black satanic robe. And in the same ad, thereâ€™s balenciaga tape. Except on it balenciaga is spelt â€œbaal-enciagaâ€ with the part â€œBaalâ€ facing the camera. And ofc Baal is one of the idols they worshipped in biblical times and was known for child sacrifice. Similar to the child sacrifice we see in todays culture with this over sexualization, abortion, etc. On top of that, similarly how you translated â€œba len ci agaâ€ into Latin and it says â€œdo what you wantâ€ (a known satanic phrase) if you type â€œBaal enci agaâ€ it translates to Baal is king. Theyâ€™re literally not even hiding it anymore because of how normalized itâ€™s become  \n",

And ofc Baal is one of the idols they worshipped in biblical times and was known for child sacrifice. Similar to the child sacrifice we see in todays culture with this over sexualization, abortion, etc. On top of that, similarly how you translated â€œba len ci agaâ€ into Latin and it says â€œdo what you wantâ€ (a known satanic phrase) if you type â€œBaal enci agaâ€ it translates to Baal is king.

       "6  Another thing I found is in one of the child ads thereâ€™s a kids drawing in the background literally depicting satan. There also a folded black satanic robe. And in the same ad, thereâ€™s balenciaga tape. Except on it balenciaga is spelt â€œbaal-enciagaâ€ with the part â€œBaalâ€ facing the camera. And ofc Baal is one of the idols they worshipped in biblical times and was known for child sacrifice. Similar to the child sacrifice we see in todays culture with this over sexualization, abortion, etc. On top of that, similarly how you translated â€œba len ci agaâ€ into Latin and it says â€œdo what you wantâ€ (a known satanic phrase) if you type â€œBaal enci agaâ€ it translates to Baal is king. Theyâ€™re literally not even hiding it anymore because of how normalized itâ€™s become   \n",
